We demonstrate preclinical synergy of telaglenastat (CB-839), a selective glutaminase inhibitor, combined with azacytidine (AZA), followed by a single-arm, open-label, phase 1b/2 study in persons with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The dual primary endpoints evaluated clinical activity, safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints evaluated pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, overall survival, event-free survival and duration of response. The dose-escalation study included six participants and the dose-expansion study included 24 participants. Therapy was well tolerated and led to an objective response rate of 70% with (marrow) complete remission in 53% of participants and a median overall survival of 11.6\u2009months, with evidence of myeloid differentiation in responders determined by single-cell RNA sequencing. Glutamine transporter solute carrier family 38 member 1 in MDS stem cells was associated with clinical responses and predictive of worse prognosis in a large MDS cohort. These data demonstrate the safety and efficacy of CB-839 and AZA as a combined metabolic and epigenetic approach in MDS. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03047993."}

Here we show that temperature is increased in tumors of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and explore how this could affect therapy response. By mimicking this observation in PDAC cell lines, we demonstrate that through adaptive changes in lipid metabolism, the temperature increase found in human PDAC confers protection to lipid peroxidation and contributes to gemcitabine resistance. Consistent with the recently uncovered role of p38 MAPK in ferroptotic cell death, we find that the reduction in lipid peroxidation potential following adaptation to tumoral temperature allows for p38 MAPK inhibition, conferring chemoresistance. As an increase in tumoral temperature is observed in several other tumor types, our findings warrant taking tumoral temperature into account in subsequent studies related to ferroptosis and therapy resistance. More broadly, our findings indicate that tumoral temperature affects cancer biology."}

We investigate the detection, timing, and HPV type specificity of somatic mutations in 3929 HPV-positive exfoliated cervical cell samples from individuals undergoing cervical screening in the U.S. using deep targeted sequencing in ICC cases, precancers, and HPV-positive controls. We discover a subset of hotspot mutations rare in controls (2.6%) but significantly more prevalent in precancers, particularly glandular precancer lesions (10.2%), and cancers (25.7%), supporting their involvement in ICC carcinogenesis. Hotspot mutations differ by HPV type, and HPV18/45-positive ICC are more likely to have multiple hotspot mutations compared to HPV16-positive ICC. The proportion of cells containing hotspot mutations is higher (i.e., higher variant allele fraction) in ICC and mutations are detectable up to 6\u2009years prior to cancer diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using exfoliated cervical cells for detection of somatic mutations as potential diagnostic biomarkers."}

However, NK cell-mediated tumor killing is often impaired by the interaction between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E and the inhibitory receptor, NKG2A. Here, we describe a strategy that overcomes CAR-NK cell inhibition mediated by the HLA-E-NKG2A immune checkpoint. We generate CD33-specific, AML-targeted CAR-NK cells (CAR33) combined with CRISPR/Cas9-based gene disruption of the NKG2A-encoding KLRC1 gene. Using single-cell multi-omics analyses, we identified transcriptional features of activation and maturation in CAR33-KLRC1ko-NK cells, which are preserved following exposure to AML cells. Moreover, CAR33-KLRC1ko-NK cells demonstrate potent antileukemic killing activity against AML cell lines and primary blasts in vitro and in vivo. We thus conclude that NKG2A-deficient CAR-NK cells have the potential to bypass immune suppression in AML."}

ISB 2001 is a CD3+ T cell engager (TCE) co-targeting BCMA and CD38 designed to improve cytotoxicity against multiple myeloma. Targeting of two tumor-associated antigens by a single TCE resulted in superior cytotoxic potency across a variable range of BCMA and CD38 tumor expression profiles mimicking natural tumor heterogeneity, improved resistance to competing soluble factors and exhibited superior cytotoxic potency on patient-derived samples and in mouse models. Despite the broad expression of CD38 across human tissues, ISB 2001 demonstrated a reduced T cell activation profile in the absence of tumor cells when compared to TCEs targeting CD38 only. To determine an optimal first-in-human dose for the ongoing clinical trial (NCT05862012), we developed an innovative quantitative systems pharmacology model leveraging preclinical data, using a minimum pharmacologically active dose approach, therefore reducing patient exposure to subefficacious doses of therapies."}

A pathologic response (primary objective) was observed in 5/10 patients, with 2 patients showing a major pathologic response. No patient achieved a complete pathologic response. A partial radiologic response (secondary objective) was observed in 3/10 patients, 5/10 patients had stable disease and 2/10 patients were non-evaluable on magnetic resonance imaging. All patients completed treatment without severe toxicity (exploratory objective). At median duration of follow-up of 22.5 months, two non-responders experienced disease recurrence. In-depth analysis of the loco-regional and systemic immune response (predefined exploratory objective) showed that monoclonal T cell expansion significantly correlated with treatment response. Tumour-draining lymph nodes displayed clonal overlap with intra-tumoural T cell expansion. All pre-specified endpoints, efficacy in terms of pathologic response as primary endpoint, radiologic response as secondary outcome and safety and tolerability as exploratory endpoint, were reached. Neoadjuvant ICB with pembrolizumab proved safe and induced pathologic, radiologic, and immunologic responses in MMRd EC, warranting further exploration of extended neoadjuvant treatment."}

Despite its catastrophic impact on survival, the critical mediators responsible for cancer cachexia development remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a distinct subset of neutrophil-like monocytes, which we term cachexia-inducible monocytes (CiMs), emerges in the advanced cancer milieu and promotes skeletal muscle loss. Unbiased transcriptome analysis reveals that interleukin 36\u2009gamma (IL36G)-producing CD38+ CiMs are induced in chronic monocytic blood cancer characterized by prominent cachexia. Notably, the emergence of CiMs and the activation of CiM-related gene signatures in monocytes are confirmed in various advanced solid cancers. Stimuli of toll-like receptor 4 signaling are responsible for the induction of CiMs. Genetic inhibition of IL36G-mediated signaling attenuates skeletal muscle loss and rescues cachexia phenotypes in advanced cancer models. These findings indicate that the IL36G-producing subset of neutrophil-like monocytes could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer cachexia."}

Using this difference as an example, we queried the mechanism(s) behind the proclivity for organ-specific metastasis. We used spontaneous and implant models of metastatic mammary carcinoma coupled with inflammatory tissue fibrosis, single-cell sequencing analyses and functional studies to unravel the causal determinants of organ-specific metastasis. Here we show that lung metastasis is facilitated by angiopoietin 2 (Ang2)-mediated suppression of lung-specific endothelial tight junction protein Claudin 5, which is augmented by the inflammatory fibrotic microenvironment and prevented by anti-Ang2 blocking antibodies, while kidney metastasis is prevented by non-Ang2-responsive Claudins 2 and 10. Suppression of Claudins 2 and 10 was sufficient to induce the emergence of kidney metastasis. This study illustrates the influence of organ-specific vascular heterogeneity in determining organotropic metastasis, independent of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms."}

Jussila", "Cory Pan", "Sadhana Gaddam", "Sylvia K. Plevritis", "Anthony E.

While we previously identified a carcinoma tumor-intrinsic resistance pathway, basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition, here, employing a multipronged single-cell and spatial-omics approach, we identify an inflammation and therapy-enriched tumor state we term basal-to-inflammatory transition. Basal-to-inflammatory transition signature correlates with poor overall patient survival in many epithelial tumors. Basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition and basal-to-inflammatory transition occur in adjacent but distinct regions of a single tumor: basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition arises within the core tumor nodule, while basal-to-inflammatory transition emerges from a specialized inflammatory environment defined by a tumor-associated TREM1 myeloid signature. TREM1 myeloid-derived cytokines IL1 and OSM induce basal-to-inflammatory transition in vitro and in vivo through NF-\u03baB, lowering sensitivity of patient basal cell carcinoma explant tumors to Smoothened inhibitor treatment. This work deepens our knowledge of the heterogeneous local tumor microenvironment and nominates basal-to-inflammatory transition as a drug-resistant but targetable tumor state driven by a specialized inflammatory microenvironment."}

Here, we identify a subgroup, PTCL-NOSSMARCB1-, which is characterized by the lack of the SMARCB1 protein and occurs more frequently in young patients. Human and murine PTCL-NOSSMARCB1- show similar DNA methylation profiles, with hypermethylation of T-cell-related genes and hypomethylation of genes involved in myeloid development. Single-cell analyses of human and murine tumors revealed a rich and complex network of interactions between tumor cells and an immunosuppressive and exhausted tumor microenvironment (TME). In a drug screen, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) as a class of drugs effective against PTCL-NOSSmarcb1-. In vivo treatment of mouse tumors with SAHA, a pan-HDACi, triggered remodeling of the TME, promoting replenishment of lymphoid compartments and reversal of the exhaustion phenotype.

To explore the genomic and immune heterogeneity across different pathological stages of MSLCs, we analyse 16 MSLCs from 8 patients using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell TCR sequencing, and bulk whole-exome sequencing. Our investigation indicates clonally independent tumours with convergent evolution driven by shared driver mutations. However, tumours from the same individual exhibit few shared mutations, indicating independent origins. During the transition from pre-invasive to invasive adenocarcinoma, we observe a shift in T cell phenotypes characterized by increased Treg cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells, accompanied by diminished cytotoxicity. Additionally, invasive adenocarcinomas exhibit greater neoantigen abundance and a more diverse TCR repertoire, indicating heightened heterogeneity. In summary, despite having a common genetic background and environmental exposure, our study emphasizes the individuality of MSLCs at different stages, highlighting their unique genomic and immune characteristics."}

Here we directly compare tumor-free TDLNs draining \u201ccold\u201d and \u201chot\u201d human triple negative breast cancers (TDLNCold and TDLNHot). Using machine-learning-based self-correlation analysis of immune gene expression, we find unbalanced intranodal regulations within TDLNCold. Two gene pairs (TBX21/GATA3-CXCR1) with opposite correlations suggest preferential priming of T helper 2 (Th2) cells by mature dendritic cells (DC) within TDLNCold. This is validated by multiplex immunofluorescent staining, identifying more mature-DC-Th2 spatial clusters within TDLNCold versus TDLNHot. Associated with this Th2 priming preference, more IL4 producing mast cells (MC) are found within sinus regions of TDLNCold. Downstream, Th2-associated fibrotic TME is found in paired cold tumors with increased Th2/T-helper-1-cell (Th1) ratio, upregulated fibrosis growth factors, and stromal enrichment of cancer associated fibroblasts. These findings are further confirmed in a validation cohort and public genomic data. Our results reveal a potential role of IL4+ MCs within TDLNs, associated with Th2 polarization and reduced immune infiltration into tumors."}

However, systematic identification of patient-specific treatments that selectively co-inhibit cancerous cell populations poses a combinatorial challenge, since the number of possible drug-dose combinations vastly exceeds what could be tested in patient cells. Here, we describe a machine learning approach, scTherapy, which leverages single-cell transcriptomic profiles to prioritize multi-targeting treatment options for individual patients with hematological cancers or solid tumors. Patient-specific treatments reveal a wide spectrum of co-inhibitors of multiple biological pathways predicted for primary cells from heterogenous cohorts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, each with unique resistance patterns and synergy mechanisms. Experimental validations confirm that 96% of the multi-targeting treatments exhibit selective efficacy or synergy, and 83% demonstrate low toxicity to normal cells, highlighting their potential for therapeutic efficacy and safety. In a pan-cancer analysis across five cancer types, 25% of the predicted treatments are shared among the patients of the same tumor type, while 19% of the treatments are patient-specific. Our approach provides a widely-applicable strategy to identify personalized treatment regimens that selectively co-inhibit malignant cells and avoid inhibition of non-cancerous cells, thereby increasing their likelihood for clinical success."}

However, precise coordinated mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) orchestrates the transcription of an oncogenic CASC15-New-Isoform 2 (CANT2) lncRNA and the coding tumor-suppressor gene CCBE1, thereby accelerating melanoma tumorigenesis. In melanoma cells, PHB2 initially accesses the open chromatin sites at the CANT2 promoter, recruiting MLL2 to augment H3K4 trimethylation and activate CANT2 transcription. Intriguingly, PHB2 further binds the activated CANT2 transcript, targeting the promoter of the tumor-suppressor\u00a0gene CCBE1. This interaction recruits histone deacetylase HDAC1 to decrease H3K27 acetylation at the CCBE1 promoter and inhibit its transcription, significantly promoting tumor\u00a0cell growth and metastasis\u00a0both in vitro and in vivo. Our study elucidates a PHB2-mediated mechanism that orchestrates the aberrant transcription of lncRNAs and coding genes, providing an intriguing epigenetic regulatory model in tumorigenesis."}

This study investigates the role of putatively functional germline variants in neuroblastoma, even if they do not directly increase disease risk. Our whole-exome sequencing analysis of 125 patients with neuroblastoma reveals a positive correlation between germline variant burden and somatic mutations. Moreover, patients with higher germline variant burden exhibit worse outcomes. Similar findings are observed in the independent neuroblastoma cohort where a higher germline variant burden correlates with a higher somatic mutational burden and a worse overall survival outcome. However, contrasting results emerge in adult-onset cancer, emphasizing the importance of germline genetics in neuroblastoma. The enrichment of putatively functional germline variants in cancer predisposition genes is borderline significant when compared to healthy populations (P\u2009=\u20090.077; Odds Ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence intervals, 0.94\u22122.21) and significantly more pronounced against adult-onset cancers (P\u2009=\u20090.016; Odds Ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence intervals, 1.10\u22123.91). Additionally, the presence of these variants proves to have prognostic significance in neuroblastoma (log-rank P\u2009<\u20090.001), and combining germline with clinical risk factors notably improves survival predictions."}

Notably, cases with hematological malignancies often have a poor prognosis due to delayed diagnosis. This study investigated the potential of readily obtainable laboratory markers to differentiate hematological causes from other etiologies during the early stages of FUO. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical records of 100 patients who fulfilled the modified FUO criteria between January 2010 and April 2023. Hematological etiologies were identified in 26 of the 100 patients. Peripheral blood neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet counts, and the systemic immune inflammation (SII) index, were significantly lower in the hematological group compared to the non-hematological group. Conversely, serum ferritin levels were demonstrably higher in the hematological group. ROC analysis identified a neutrophil-to-ferritin ratio (NFR) cutoff value of <\u20098.53 as optimal for predicting hematological etiology. Subsequent multivariate analysis demonstrated that the NFR was the sole independent predictor of hematological etiology (p\u2009=\u20090.013).This study proposes a novel approach for early diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening subset of FUO patients. The NFR presents as an inexpensive and readily available marker for predicting hematological etiology in FUO cases."}

Here we generated murine CAR-NKT cells and compared them with CAR-T cells in immune-competent mice. Both CAR-NKT cells and CAR-T cells showed similar antitumor effects in vitro, but CAR-NKT cells showed superior antitumor activity in vivo via CD1d-dependent immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we show that CAR-NKT cells eliminate CD1d-expressing M2-like macrophages. In addition, CAR-NKT cells promote epitope spreading and activation of endogenous T cell responses against tumor-associated neoantigens. Finally, we observed that CAR-NKT cells can co-express PD1 and TIM3 and show an exhaustion phenotype in a model of high tumor burden. PD1 blockade as well as vaccination augmented the antitumor activity of CAR-NKT cells. In summary, our results demonstrate the multimodal function of CAR-NKT cells in solid tumors, further supporting the rationale for developing CAR-NKT therapies in the clinic."}

We sought to understand the historical management of biologically favorable DCIS and to determine the outcomes of patients who did not have immediate surgery. Using data from the NCDB from 2004 to 2017, the selected cohort included women >40 years of age, with low or intermediate grade and hormone receptor (HR) positive DCIS. AS was defined as either no surgery or surgery >12 months from diagnosis. Women in the AS group were compared to women who had immediate surgery. A Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the trend of AS over year of diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated to compare overall survival (OS), stratified by age (<50, 50\u201364, \u226565), and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effects of prognostic factors on survival distributions. 74,367 women met study inclusion criteria; 2384 (3.2%) were treated with AS. The proportion of patients in the AS cohort increased yearly, peaking in 2017 at 4.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.01). On multivariable analysis, increasing age (OR 1.02, p\u2009<\u20090.01), black race (OR 1.7, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and being uninsured (OR 2.2, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were associated with increased likelihood of AS. In women <50 years of age, OS outcomes were similar, with 10-year OS of 97.4% in the immediate surgery cohort versus 99.1% in AS cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.43). The proportion of patients with DCIS treated with AS has remained small but is increasing over time.

The research retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of MM patients and found that the occurrence of POD24 is an independent prognostic factor affecting overall survival in MM, while non-transplantion and genetic abnormality are independent risk factors for the occurrence of POD24. The existing prognostic models are not effective in predicting POD24. Therefore, it\u2019s still necessary to explore a prognostic model that can predict POD24 more accurately."}

Two commonly utilized puncture needles for thyroid FNA are the conventional syringe needle and the stylet needle. Syringe needles are known for their cost-effectiveness in comparison to stylet needles. This study aimed to determine if FNA with syringe needles is non-inferior to FNA with stylet needles in terms of specimen adequacy while also comparing the direct costs associated with both needle types. A total of 220 thyroid nodules from 185 patients were prospectively included in this study. The same operator performed a total of four punctures on the same nodule twice using a syringe and a stylet needle. The results of this study show that the utilization of syringe needles for thyroid FNA was non-inferior to the use of stylet needles in terms of specimen adequacy. Cost analysis revealed that syringe needle FNA was not only less expensive (CNY 500.9 versus CNY 780) but also more effective (adequacy 85.91% versus 84.55%). In summary, given the global prevalence of FNA procedures, the economic considerations are paramount, and our findings support the routine use of syringe needles in thyroid FNA."}

Large-scale Transitions (LSTs), defined as chromosomal breakages leading to gains or losses of at least 10\u00a0Mb, have recently emerged as a metric of CIN due to their standardized definition across platforms. Herein, we report the feasibility of using low-pass Whole Genome Sequencing to assess LSTs, copy number alterations (CNAs) and their relationship in individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Initial assessment of LSTs in breast cancer cell lines consistently showed wide-ranging values (median 22, range 4\u201333, mean 21), indicating heterogeneous CIN. Subsequent analysis of CTCs revealed LST values (median 3, range 0\u201318, mean 5), particularly low during treatment, suggesting temporal changes in CIN levels. CNAs averaged 30 (range 5\u201349), with loss being predominant. As expected, CTCs with higher LSTs values exhibited increased CNAs. A CNA-based classifier of individual patient-derived CTCs, developed using machine learning, identified genes associated with both DNA proliferation and repair, such as RB1, MYC, and EXO1, as significant predictors of CIN. The model demonstrated a high predictive accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Overall, these findings suggest that sequencing CTCs holds the potential to facilitate CIN evaluation and provide insights into its dynamic nature over time, with potential implications for monitoring TNBC progression through iterative assessments."}

This study aims to investigate the influence of family tumor history on disease-free survival, tumor metabolism, and treatment response in NSCLC patients. A retrospective, single-center study of 414 NSCLC patients was conducted, with 101 patients having a family history of cancer (FHC). Disease-free survival (DFS), tumor glucose metabolism assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT, and treatment response to chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy were analyzed. Multivariate modeling was performed to improve prognostic prediction. Patients with FHC exhibited higher TNM staging, increased susceptibility to lymph node invasion, and elevated tumor glucose metabolism levels. Family history of cancer, particularly colorectal and lung cancer, was a significant risk factor for disease-free survival. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy significantly improved patient prognosis, while family history of cancer affected the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy but not targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Multivariate modeling combining FHC, treatment, and tumor metabolism levels yielded improved predictive performance. Our study highlights the importance of considering a patient\u2019s family history when assessing risk profiles and formulating treatment decisions for NSCLC patients. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these observed associations and to develop more effective treatment strategies for NSCLC patients with a cancer family history."}

Chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure attenuates autoimmunity through promotion of poorly understood immune-suppressive mechanisms. Here we show that mice with subcutaneous melanoma are not responsive to anti-PD1 immunotherapy following chronic UV irradiation, given prior to tumor injection, due to the suppression of T cell killing ability in skin-draining lymph nodes. Using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyzes, we discover that skin-specific, UV-induced suppression of T-cells killing activity is mediated by upregulation of a Ly6ahigh T-cell subpopulation. Independently of the UV effect, Ly6ahigh T cells are induced by chronic type-1 interferon in the tumor microenvironment. Treatment with an anti-Ly6a antibody enhances the anti-tumoral cytotoxic activity of T cells and reprograms their mitochondrial metabolism via the Erk/cMyc axis. Treatment with an anti-Ly6a antibody inhibits tumor growth in mice resistant to anti-PD1 therapy. Applying our findings in humans could lead to an immunotherapy treatment for patients with resistance to existing treatments."}

Secondary endpoints demonstrated sustained clinical responses, favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and a 6-month progression-free survival of 82%. Vactosertib combined with pomalidomide was well-tolerated at all dose levels and displayed a manageable adverse event profile. Exploratory analysis indicated that vactosertib co-treatment with pomalidomide also reduced TGF\u03b2 levels in patient bone marrow as well as the level of CD8+ T-cells that expressed the immunoinhibitory marker PD-1. In vitro experiments indicated that vactosertib+pomalidomide co-treatment decreased the viability of MM cell lines and patient tumor cells, and increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity. Vactosertib is a safe therapeutic that demonstrates tumor-intrinsic activity and can overcome immunosuppressive challenges within the tumor microenvironment to reinvigorate T-cell fitness. Vactosertib offers promise to improve immunotherapeutic responses in heavily-pretreated MM patients refractory to conventional agents."}

Here, we therefore aim to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in primary high grade serous ovarian cancer with whole genome duplication by assessing differentially expressed genes and pathways in 79 samples. We observe that MHC-II expression is lowest in tumors which have acquired whole genome duplication early in tumor evolution, and further demonstrate that reduced MHC-II expression occurs in subsets of tumor cells rather than in canonical antigen-presenting cells. Early whole genome duplication is also associated with worse patient survival outcomes. Our results suggest an association between the timing of whole genome duplication, MHC-II expression and clinical outcome in high grade serous ovarian cancer that warrants further investigation for therapeutic targeting."}

These cancers are frequently sensitive to therapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the metastatic setting. This sensitivity seems to be even more pronounced in locally advanced disease, and organ preservation has become a realistic aim in ongoing clinical trials involving patients with dMMR rectal cancer. By contrast, metastatic CRCs with proficient DNA mismatch repair (pMMR) are generally resistant to ICIs, although a proportion of locally advanced pMMR tumours seem to have a high degree of sensitivity to ICIs. In this Review, we describe the current and emerging clinical evidence supporting the use of neoadjuvant ICIs in patients with dMMR and pMMR CRC, and the potential advantages (based on a biological rationale) of such an approach. We discuss how neoadjuvant \u2018window-of-opportunity\u2019 trials are being leveraged to progress biomarker discovery and we provide an overview of potential predictive biomarkers of response to ICIs, exploring the challenges faced when evaluating such biomarkers in biopsy-derived samples. Lastly, we describe how these discoveries might be used to drive a rational approach to trialling novel immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with pMMR CRC, with the ultimate aim of disease eradication and the generation of long-term immunosurveillance."}

All LGE cases were retrospectively reviewed during a 20-year period. Clinical diagnoses, pathological diagnoses, patient demographic data, and clinical information were analyzed. The prevalence of LGEs was determined and categorized based on their nature, and concordance rates between clinical and pathological diagnoses among the groups were evaluated. Finally, a diagnostic guide was developed using clinical information through a decision tree model. Of 14,487 biopsied cases, 946 cases (6.53%) were identified as LGEs. The majority of LGEs were reactive lesions (72.62%), while a small subset was malignant tumors (7.51%). Diagnostic concordance rates were lower in malignant LGEs (54.93%) compared to non-malignant LGEs (80.69%). Size, consistency, color, duration, and patient age were identified as pivotal factors to formulate a clinical diagnostic guide for distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant LGEs. Using a decision tree model, we propose a novel diagnostic guide to assist clinicians in enhancing the accuracy of clinical differentiation between malignant and non-malignant LGEs."}

Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. From 2019 to 2021, 37 patients were enrolled. The most common primary sites were the pancreas (37.8%), stomach (16.2%) and colon (10.8%). Twenty-five patients (67.6%) were poorly differentiated carcinomas (NECs) and/or had a Ki67 index >55%. The ORR was 56.8%. Median PFS was 5.7 months (95%CI: 5.1-9) and median OS 13.9 months (95%CI: 8.3-Not reached), with a 12-month OS rate of 54.1% (95%CI: 40.2-72.8) that did not meet the primary endpoint. However, 37.6% of patients were long-term survivors (>2 years). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. There was one treatment-related death.

Increasing the intracellular concentrations of Cu or I ions may efficiently inhibit tumor growth. However, efficient delivery of Cu and I ions into tumor cells is still a challenge, as Cu chelation and iodide salts are highly water-soluble and can release in untargeted tissue. Here we report mitochondria-targeted Cu-I cluster nanoparticles using the reaction of Cu+ and I\u2212 to form stable bovine serum albumin (BSA) radiation-induced phosphors (Cu-I@BSA). These solve the stability issues of Cu+ and I\u2212 ions. Cu-I@BSA exhibit bright radioluminescence, and easily conjugate with the emission-matched photosensitizer and targeting molecule using functional groups on the surface of BSA. Investigations in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that radioluminescence under low-dose X-ray irradiation excites the conjugated photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen, and combines with the radiosensitization mechanism of the heavy atom of iodine, resulting in efficient tumor inhibition in female mice. Furthermore, our study reveals that BSA protection causes the biodegradable Cu-I clusters to release free Cu and I ions and induce cell death by modulating mitochondrial function, damaging DNA, disrupting the tricarboxylic acid cycle, decreasing ATP generation, amplifying oxidative stress, and boosting the Bcl-2 pathway."}

Utilizing longitudinal ctDNA data from the large phase 3 IMpower150 study (NCT02366143) of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with stage IV non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), here we report that post-treatment ctDNA response correlates significantly with radiographic response. However, only modest concordance is identified, revealing that ctDNA response is likely not a surrogate for radiographic response; both provide distinct information. Various ctDNA metrics, especially early ctDNA nadirs, emerge as primary predictors for progression-free survival and overall survival, potentially better assessing long-term benefits for chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC. Integrating radiographic and ctDNA assessments enhances prediction of survival outcomes. We also identify optimal cutoff values for risk stratification and key assessment timepoints, notably Weeks 6\u20139, for insights into clinical outcomes. Overall, our identified optimal ctDNA parameters can enhance the prediction of clinical outcomes, refine trial designs, and inform therapeutic decisions for first-line NSCLC patients."}

The systematic screening of populations at risk with low-dose CT, the implementation of novel surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques and a deeper biological understanding of NSCLC that has led to innovative systemic treatment options have improved the prognosis of patients with NSCLC. In non-metastatic NSCLC, the combination of various perioperative strategies and adjuvant immunotherapy in locally advanced disease seem to enhance cure rates. In metastatic NSCLC, the implementation of novel drugs might prolong disease control together with preserving quality of life. The further development of predictive clinical and genetic markers will be essential for the next steps in individualized treatment concepts."}

Konstantinopoulos", "Dipanjan Chowdhury"], "abstract": "53BP1 nucleates the anti-end resection machinery at DNA double-strand breaks, thereby countering BRCA1 activity. Loss of 53BP1 leads to DNA end processing and homologous recombination in BRCA1-deficient cells. Consequently, BRCA1-mutant tumors, typically sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), become resistant in the absence of 53BP1. Here, we demonstrate that the \u2018leaky\u2019 DNA end resection in the absence of 53BP1 results in increased micronuclei and cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and pro-inflammatory signaling. This enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration, activates macrophages and natural killer cells, and impedes tumor growth. Loss of 53BP1 correlates with a response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and improved overall survival. Immunohistochemical assessment of 53BP1 in two malignancies, high grade serous ovarian cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which are refractory to ICBs, reveals that lower 53BP1 levels correlate with an increased adaptive and innate immune response. Finally, BRCA1-deficient tumors that develop resistance to PARPi due to the loss of 53BP1 are susceptible to ICB. Therefore, we conclude that 53BP1 is critical for tumor immunogenicity and underpins the response to ICB. Our results support including 53BP1 expression as an exploratory biomarker in ICB trials for malignancies typically refractory to immunotherapy."}

Cardiovascular toxicities related to amivantamab have not been reported in the CHRYSALIS study. However, the occurrence of cardiovascular events in the real world is unknown. To comprehensively investigate the clinical characteristics, onset times, and outcomes of cardiovascular toxicities associated with amivantamab. The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 1st quarter of 2019 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 was retrospectively queried to extract reports of cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) associated with amivantamab. To perform disproportionality analysis, the reporting odds ratios (RORs) and information components (ICs) were calculated with statistical shrinkage trans-formation formulas and a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for ROR (ROR025)\u2009>\u20091 or IC (IC025)\u2009>\u20090 with at least 3 reports was considered statistically significant. A total of 20,270,918 eligible records were identified, among which 98 records were related to cardiovascular events associated with amivantamab. 4 categories of cardiovascular events exhibited positive signals: venous thrombotic diseases, abnormal blood pressure, arrhythmia, and pericardial effusion. Venous thrombotic diseases and abnormal blood pressure were the two most common signals. The median time to onset (TTO) for cardiovascular AEs was 33\u00a0days. The cumulative incidence within 90\u00a0days was 100% for cardiac failure, 75% for stroke, 63.16% for arrhythmia, 50% for sudden death, and 44.18% for venous thrombotic diseases. Death accounted for 16.3% of all cardiovascular AEs associated with amivantamab. The mortality rates for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were up to 60%. This pharmacovigilance study systematically explored the cardiovascular adverse events of amivantamab and provided new safety signals based on past safety information. Early and intensified monitoring is crucial, and attention should be directed towards high-risk signals."}

Direct comparisons showed that the addition of bevacizumab or chemotherapy to first-generation (1G) EGFR-TKIs improved overall survival (OS) compared to 1G TKIs alone, with HRs of 0.704 (95% CI: 0.433\u20130.973) and 0.682 (95% CI: 0.464\u20130.899), respectively. However, third-generation (3G) TKI monotherapy did not significantly improve OS compared with 1G TKIs, with an HR of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.511\u20131.198). Indirect comparisons suggested that the combination of 3G TKIs with chemotherapy provided the most significant improvements in OS and progression-free survival (PFS), significantly outperforming 3G TKIs, with HRs of OS 1.69 (95% CI: 1.14\u20133.4) and PFS 2.13 (95% CI: 1.28\u20133.54). Intracranial PFS was best with 1G TKIs plus bevacizumab.

Moreover, therapeutic strategy for MPAL remains unclear, and prognosis is overall poor. We performed multiomic single cell profiling of 14 newly diagnosed adult MPAL patients to characterize the inter- and intra-tumoral transcriptional, immunophenotypic, and genetic landscapes of MPAL. We show that neither genetic profile nor transcriptome reliably correlate with specific MPAL immunophenotypes. Despite this, we find that MPAL blasts express a shared stem cell-like transcriptional profile indicative of high differentiation potential. Patients with the highest differentiation potential demonstrate inferior survival in our dataset. A gene set score, MPAL95, derived from genes highly enriched in the most stem-like MPAL cells, is applicable to bulk RNA sequencing data and is predictive of survival in an independent patient cohort, suggesting a potential strategy for clinical risk stratification."}

This increase in WGD frequency is observed across multiple cancer types, including breast, endometrial, and lung cancer, and is associated with shorter patient survival. We further demonstrate that combustion byproducts are capable of inducing WGDs in cell culture, and cancers from self-reported Black patients exhibit mutational signatures consistent with exposure to these carcinogens. In total, these findings identify a type of genomic alteration that is associated with environmental exposures and that may influence racial disparities in cancer outcomes."}

Post-vaccine single-cell transcriptomics reveal dichotomous antitumor responses, with reduced tumor B-cells (tracked by unique B cell receptor) and their survival pathways, but no change in clonal plasma cells. Downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and paradoxical upregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) by the latter suggest resistance mechanisms. Vaccine therapy activates and expands bone marrow T-cell clonotypes, and functional neoantigen-specific responses (secondary endpoint), but not co-inhibitory pathways or Treg, and reduces protumoral signaling by myeloid cells, suggesting favorable perturbation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Future strategies may require combinations of vaccines with agents targeting plasma cell subpopulations, or blockade of IGF-1 signaling or myeloid cell checkpoints."}

Wang", "Peter Van Loo", "Xiao Zhao"], "abstract": "Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) with genomic alterations have a heightened risk of evolving into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Currently, genomic data are typically obtained through invasive tissue biopsy. However, brush biopsy is a non-invasive method that has been utilized for identifying dysplastic cells in OPMD but its effectiveness in reflecting the genomic landscape of OPMDs remains uncertain. This pilot study investigates the potential of brush biopsy samples in accurately reconstructing the genomic profile and tumor evolution in a patient with both OPMD and OSCC. We analyzed single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number aberrations (CNAs), and subclonal architectures in paired tissue and brush biopsy samples. The results showed that brush biopsy effectively captured 90% of SNVs and had similar CNA profiles as those seen in its paired tissue biopsies in all lesions. It was specific, as normal buccal mucosa did not share these genomic alterations. Interestingly, brush biopsy revealed shared SNVs and CNAs between the distinct OPMD and OSCC lesions from the same patient, indicating a common ancestral origin. Subclonal reconstruction confirmed this shared ancestry, followed by divergent evolution of the lesions. These findings highlight the potential of brush biopsies in accurately representing the genomic profile of OPL and OSCC, proving insight into reconstructing tumor evolution."}

Nevertheless, substantial challenges limit the applications of multispecific antibodies in cancer therapy, particularly inefficient targeting of solid tumours and substantial adverse effects. Both PET and single photon emission CT imaging can reveal the biodistribution and complex pharmacology of radiolabelled multispecific antibodies. This Review summarizes the insights obtained from preclinical and clinical molecular imaging studies of multispecific antibodies, focusing on their structural properties, such as molecular weight, shape, target specificity, affinity and avidity.

Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, one-way analysis of variance, the Jonckheere\u2013Terpstra test, and multiple linear regression. Pre-treatment BMI showed a statistically significant relationship with postoperative oral function, particularly tongue pressure (P\u2009=\u20090.01). While the mean values of the groups showed no significant differences, the Jonckheere\u2013Terpstra test revealed a statistically significant trend toward a stepwise increase in tongue pressure for each BMI group (P\u2009=\u20090.03). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between tongue pressure and pre-treatment BMI (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pre-treatment BMI was significantly associated with tongue pressure. Since BMI is a variable factor that can be controlled by nutritional therapy even before treatment, nutritional intervention, weight control, and treatment strategies including reconstructive interventions to maintain tongue pressure may be important in oral cancer treatment."}

We find that tuning the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle core composition with non-ionizable monomers can enhance cellular association of HUNPs by more than ten-fold, resulting in a high cellular internalization efficiency of HUNPs with up to 50% in tumours. Combining high tumour accumulation and high cell internalization efficiency, HUNPs show orthogonally amplified fluorescence signals, permitting the precise locating and delineating margins between malignant lesions and normal tissues with high contrast-to-noise ratio and resolution. Our study provides key strategies to design nanomedicines with high intracellular bioavailability for cancer detection, drug/gene delivery, and therapy."}

Van den Eynde"], "abstract": "While adoptive cell therapy has shown success in hematological malignancies, its potential against solid tumors is hindered by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In recent years, members of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family have gained recognition as important regulators of T-cell metabolism and function. The role of HIF signalling in activated CD8 T cell function in the context of adoptive cell transfer, however, has not been explored in full depth. Here we utilize CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD) 2 and 3, thereby stabilizing HIF-1 signalling, in CD8 T cells that have already undergone differentiation and activation, modelling the T cell phenotype utilized in clinical settings. We observe a significant boost in T-cell activation and effector functions following PHD2/3 deletion, which is dependent on HIF-1\u03b1, and is accompanied by an increased glycolytic flux. This improvement in CD8 T cell performance translates into an enhancement in tumor response to adoptive T cell therapy in mice, across various tumor models, even including those reported to be extremely resistant to immunotherapeutic interventions. These findings hold promise for advancing CD8 T-cell based therapies and overcoming the immune suppression barriers within challenging tumor microenvironments."}

This randomized phase II trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant fulvestrant (Fulv) alone or with enzalutamide (Combo) assessed whether adding AR blockade to Fulv would limit residual tumor at the time of surgery, as measured by modified preoperative endocrine predictive index (PEPI) score. Eligible patients were women with ER+/HER2\u2212 primary BC cT2 or greater. Stratification factors were clinical node and T-stage. Fresh tumor biopsies were required at study entry, after 4 weeks on therapy (W5), and at surgery. Laboratory analyses on tumors included immunochemistry (IHC) for ER/PR/AR/GR and Ki67 protein, evaluation of gene expression, multiplex for myeloid lineage immune cells, reverse-phase protein array, and plasma metabolomic analyses. Of 69 consented patients, 59 were evaluable. Toxicity was as expected with endocrine therapy. Combo achieved PEPI\u2009=\u20090 more frequently (24%: 8/33) than Fulv (8%: 2/26). Ki67 was \u226410% across arms by W5 in 76% of tumors. Activation of mTOR pathway proteins was elevated in tumors with poor Ki67 response. Tumors in both arms showed decreased estrogen-regulated and cell division gene sets, while Combo arm tumors uniquely exhibited enrichment of immune activation gene sets, including interferon gamma, complement, inflammation, antigen processing, and B and T cell activation. Multiplex IHC showed significantly reduced tumor-associated macrophages and CD14+/HLADR\u2212/CD68\u2212 MDSCs in Combo tumors at W5. In summary, Combo tumors showed a higher PEPI\u2009=\u20090 response, Ki67 response, and more activated tumor immune microenvironment than Fulv. The odds of response were 4.6-fold higher for patients with ILC versus IDC.

We conducted a case-control study that included 9,191 patients with a diagnosis of head and neck cancer in Taiwan\u2019s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010 and 36,764 matched controls. We assessed the odds of patients with head and neck cancer having had a diagnosis of herpes zoster during the five years preceding head and neck cancer using multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of prior herpes zoster among the total sample was 4.6%, 7.9% and 3.8% among patients with and without head and neck cancer, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The odds ratio of herpes zoster among the head and neck cancer- versus control group was 2.198 (95% CI\u2009=\u20092.001\u2009~\u20092.415) after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use disorder, HPV infection, and alcohol dependence syndrome. Statistically significant excess odds were observed for all specific subtypes of head and neck cancer except for sinonasal cancer. Herpes zoster infection within the 5 years preceding a diagnosis of head and neck cancer may be a harbinger of developing head and neck cancer."}

Here we analyse FFPE cancer WGS datasets from England\u2019s 100,000 Genomes Project, comparing 578 FFPE samples with 11,014 fresh frozen (FF) samples across multiple tumour types. We use an approach that characterises rather than discards artefacts. We identify three artefactual signatures, including one known (SBS57) and two previously uncharacterised (SBS FFPE, ID FFPE), and develop an \u201cFFPEImpact\u201d score that quantifies sample artefacts. Despite inferior sequencing quality, FFPE-derived data identifies clinically-actionable variants, mutational signatures and permits algorithmic stratification. Matched FF/FFPE validation cohorts shows good concordance while acknowledging SBS, ID and copy-number artefacts. While FF-derived WGS data remains the gold standard, FFPE-samples can be used for WGS if required, using analytical advancements developed here, potentially democratising whole cancer genomics to many."}

Neurosurgeons perform tumor resection based on tactile sensations. However, it takes years of surgical experience to appropriately distinguish brain tumors from surrounding parenchymal tissue. Haptics is a technology related to the touch sensation. Haptic technology can amplify, transmit, record, and reproduce real sensations, and the physical properties (e.g., stiffness) of an object can be quantified. In the present study, glioblastoma (SF126-firefly luciferase-mCherry [FmC], U87-FmC, U251-FmC) and malignant meningioma (IOMM-Lee-FmC, HKBMM-FmC) cell lines were transplanted into nude mice, and the stiffness of tumors and normal brain tissues were measured using our newly developed surgical forceps equipped with haptic technology. We found that all five brain tumor tissues were stiffer than normal brain tissue (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and that brain tumor pathology (three types of glioblastomas, two types of malignant meningioma) was significantly stiffer than normal brain tissue (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all). Our findings suggest that tissue stiffness may be a useful marker to distinguish brain tumors from surrounding parenchymal tissue during microsurgery, and that haptic forceps may help neurosurgeons to sense minute changes in tissue stiffness."}

At later timepoints, CJ215 provided tumour-to-muscle contrast ratios up to 100 and tumour-to-liver contrast ratios up to 18.

The consequent use of masks on wards for allo-HSCT has been controversial in the past decades and was not common before the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively compared incidence and outcomes of viral respiratory infections during allo-HSCT on our specialized ward between 01/2018 and 09/2020 to the era of FFP2 masking between 10/2020 and 10/2022 covering similar seasons of the year. Each group consisted of 150 matched patients. The usage of FFP2 masks reduced the incidence of viral respiratory infections from 22.1 to 2.1% (p\u2009<\u20090.005). This reduced the time on ward from a median of 26\u00a0days to 23.5\u00a0days (p\u2009=\u20090.002). It also resulted in less use of CT-scans (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and bronchoalveolar lavage procedures (p\u2009=\u20090.057). Median time to proof of infection was 21\u00a0days after admission in both groups. No difference was detected in progression free survival, hospital survival or non-relapse mortality (p\u2009=\u20090.78). Our retrospective results indicate that FFP2 masks worn by patients and hospital staff may help to significantly reduce the incidence of viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, shorten the in-hospital time, and reduce costs without affecting survival."}

Here, we show an expansion of MDS hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with a granulo-monocytic-biased transcriptional differentiation state in MDS patients who initially responded to venetoclax but eventually relapsed. While MDS HSCs in an undifferentiated cellular state are sensitive to venetoclax treatment, differentiation towards a granulo-monocytic-biased transcriptional state, through the acquisition or expansion of clones with STAG2 or RUNX1 mutations, affects HSCs\u2019 survival dependence from BCL2-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways to TNF\u03b1-induced pro-survival NF-\u03baB signaling and drives resistance to venetoclax-mediated cytotoxicity.

Pollak", "Helena Jernstr\u00f6m"], "abstract": "There has been a long-standing interest in targeting the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) signaling system in breast cancer due to its key role in neoplastic proliferation and survival. However, no IGF-1R targeting agent has shown substantial clinical benefit in controlled phase 3 trials, and no biomarker has been shown to have clinical utility in the prediction of benefit from an IGF-1R targeting agent. IGFBP7 is an atypical insulin-like growth factor binding protein as it has a higher affinity for the IGF-1R than IGF ligands. We report that low IGFBP7 gene expression identifies a subset of breast cancers for which the addition of ganitumab, an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, substantially improved the pathological complete response rate compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. The pCR rate in the chemotherapy plus ganitumab arm was 46.9% in patients in the lowest quartile of IGFBP7 expression, in contrast to only 5.6% in the highest quartile. Furthermore, high IGFBP7 expression predicted increased distant metastasis risk. If our findings are confirmed, decisions to halt the development of IGF-1R targeting drugs, which were based on disappointing results of prior trials that did not use predictive biomarkers, should be reviewed."}

While this is well understood, the comprehensive analysis of WNT and TGF-Beta pathway alterations in young-onset CRC cases has yet to be investigated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of mutations associated with each of the WNT and TGF-Beta signaling pathways according to age (\u2264\u200950\u00a0years old versus >\u200950\u00a0years old) utilizing published genomic data from the cBioPortal.

The data of hormone receptor-negative invasive breast cancer patients who underwent BCS were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015. All patients were separated into two groups, namely, the RT group and the no radiotherapy (No RT) group. The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were compared between the No RT and RT groups after propensity score matching (PSM). The nomograms for predicting the survival of patients were constructed from variables identified by univariate or multivariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 2504 patients were enrolled in the training cohort, and 630 patients were included in the validation cohort. After PSM, 738 patients were enrolled in the No RT group and RT group. We noted that RT can improve survival in hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients who undergo BCS. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, age, race, tumour grade, receipt of RT and chemotherapy, pathological T stage, N status, M status and HER2 status were linked to OS and CSS for these patients, and nomograms for predicting OS and CSS were constructed and validated. Moreover, RT improved OS and CSS in hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients who underwent BCS. In addition, the proposed nomograms more accurately predicted OS and CSS for hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients after BCS."}

Despite its scarceness, there is growing evidence that MBC should not be studied and treated as FBC due to factors like later diagnosis stage and distinct genetic makeup. Retrospective observational study in the EpiChron Cohort, selecting all the prevalent patients with breast cancer between 2010 and 2019. Logistic models were used to determine associated comorbidities. Between 2010 and 2019, 105 MBC and 11,657 FBC patients were found in the EpiChron Cohort. MBC patients had a high mean age at diagnosis and number of comorbidities. Paying attention to comorbidity prevalences in breast cancer patients, it was clear that MBC patients tended to be prone to cardio-metabolic coexisting diseases, while FBC patients were more prone to hormone-, bone- and mental diseases. There were nine chronic conditions associated to MBC patients, but after a year-by-birth matching only four associations remained. Two of them were associated previously [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)]: \u201cDisorder of lipid metabolism\u201d [1.65 (1.03\u20132.64)] and \u201cGenitourinary symptoms and ill-defined conditions\u201d [2.03 (1.07\u20133.87)]; and the other two were new, \u201cAnxiety disorders\u201d [2.05 (1.09\u20133.87)] and \u201cOsteoporosis\u201d [3.58 (1.26\u201310.14)]. After comparing associated comorbidities in FBC with those in MBC, it seems MBC patients share some of them, but they have their own particular set of coexisting diseases. In fact, once a year-by-birth matching was performed in MBC patient cohort, it was more obvious MBC comorbidities behave more similar to none-Breast-Cancer male population than to FBC patients. These findings highlight the distinct characteristics of the MBC patient population and the need for a tailored approach of managing MBC."}

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor, expresses neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is insensitive to chemo- and radiotherapies, and the effectiveness of immunotherapies remains unknown. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment would facilitate effective therapies and provide evidence on CGRP\u2019s function outside the nervous system. Here, we compare the single-cell landscape of MTC and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and find that expression of CGRP in MTC is associated with dendritic cell (DC) abnormal development characterized by activation of cAMP related pathways and high levels of Kruppel Like Factor 2 (KLF2), correlated with an impaired activity of tumor infiltrating T cells. A CGRP receptor antagonist could offset CGRP detrimental impact on DC development in vitro. Our study provides insights of the MTC immunosuppressive microenvironment, and proposes CGRP receptor as a potential therapeutic target."}

Thus, identifying the aberrant genes and proteins underlying disease pathogenesis is critical to improve early detection methods and develop novel therapeutic strategies. Chromosome instability (CIN), or ongoing changes in chromosome complements, is a predominant form of genome instability. It is a driver of genetic heterogeneity found in ~85% of CRCs. Although CIN contributes to CRC pathogenesis, the molecular determinants underlying CIN remain poorly understood. Recently, EMI1, an F-box protein, was identified as a candidate CIN gene. In this study, we sought to determine the impact reduced EMI1 expression has on CIN and cellular transformation."}

This retrospective cohort study included consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent LRP treatment at Wuhan Union Hospital from June 2, 2016, to September 7, 2023. PPATT was defined as the thickness of periprostatic fat and was obtained by measuring the shortest vertical distance from the pubic symphysis to the prostate on the midsagittal T2-weighted MR images. Subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (SATT) was obtained by measuring the shortest vertical distance from the pubic symphysis to the skin at the same slice with PPATT. The primary outcome of the study was biochemical recurrence (BCR), and the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors for prostate cancer survival and prognosis. Based on the optimal cutoff value, 162 patients were divided into a low PPATT/SATT group (n\u2009=\u200982) and a high PPATT/SATT group (n\u2009=\u200980). During the entire follow-up period (median 23.5\u00a0months), 26 patients in the high PPATT/SATT group experienced BCR (32.5%), compared to 18 in the low PPATT/SATT group (22.0%). Kaplan\u2013Meier curve analysis indicated that the interval to BCR was significantly shorter in the high PPATT/SATT group (P\u2009=\u20090.037). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that an increase in the PPATT/SATT ratio was associated with BCR (hazard ratio: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.03\u20133.51; P\u2009=\u20090.040). The PPATT/SATT ratio is a significant independent risk factor for BCR after LRP for prostate cancer patients."}

However, the identities and traits of these cells, and the potential for improving cancer therapy through their targeting, remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a senescent subset within previously-defined cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) and in premalignant lesions in mice and humans. Senescent CAFs isolated from mouse and humans expressed elevated levels of immune-regulatory genes. Depletion of senescent CAFs, either genetically or using the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax), increased the proportion of activated CD8+ T cells in mouse pancreatic carcinomas, whereas induction of CAF senescence had the opposite effect. Combining ABT-199 with an immune checkpoint therapy regimen significantly reduced mouse tumor burden. These results indicate that senescent CAFs in PDAC stroma limit the numbers of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and suggest that their targeted elimination through senolytic treatment may enhance immunotherapy."}

However, the current immunogenicity induced by OVs for tumor treatment is relatively weak, necessitating a thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying its induction of antitumor immunity. Here, we show that HSV-1-based OVs (oHSVs) trigger ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis (a unique innate immune inflammatory cell death modality), resulting in augmented antitumor immune effects. Mechanistically, oHSV enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, leading to the accumulation of endogenous Z-RNA and subsequent activation of ZBP1. To further enhance the antitumor potential of oHSV, we conduct a screening and identify Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane vesicle (Fn-OMV) that can increase the expression of PANoptosis execution proteins. The combination of Fn-OMV and oHSV demonstrates potent antitumor immunogenicity. Taken together, our study provides a deeper understanding of oHSV-induced antitumor immunity, and demonstrates a promising strategy that combines oHSV with Fn-OMV."}

This increased spending on anticancer therapies largely reflects the high launch prices of novel therapeutics and increases in the prices of existing products, even in the absence of new evidence of clinical benefit or changes in use. Consequently, high prices have impeded Americans\u2019 access to and affordability of necessary anticancer therapies and thus increased their risk of cost-related non-adherence, cancer recurrence and mortality. To address the rising prices and concerns regarding Americans\u2019 spending on anticancer therapies, state and federal governments have, over the past decade, enacted legislation that caps out-of-pocket spending, expands subsidies and requires drug price negotiations. In this Perspective, we summarize US policies aimed to lower the costs of anticancer therapies, discuss the implications of such reforms and propose additional solutions needed to reduce costs and increase value."}

We have developed Nanodynamo, an experimental and computational workflow for quantifying the kinetic rates of nuclear and cytoplasmic steps of the RNA life cycle. Nanodynamo is based on mathematical modelling following sequencing of native RNA from cellular fractions and polysomes. We have applied this workflow to triple-negative breast cancer cells, revealing widespread post-transcriptional RNA processing that is mutually exclusive with its co-transcriptional counterpart. We used Nanodynamo to unravel the coupling between transcription, processing, export, decay and translation machineries. We have identified a number of coupling interactions within and between the nucleus and cytoplasm that largely contribute to coordinating how cells respond to perturbations that affect gene expression programs. Nanodynamo will be instrumental in unravelling the determinants and regulatory processes involved in the coordination of gene expression responses."}

Thus, developing feasible therapeutic strategies that trigger inflammatory responses in the TME could improve the ICB efficacy. Mitochondria play an essential role in inflammation regulation and tumor immunogenicity induction. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a class of small molecules that can recapitulate aqueous self-assembly behavior, specifically target cellular organelles (e.g., mitochondria), and invigorate tumor cell immunogenicity. Mechanistically, this nanoassembly platform dynamically rewires mitochondria, induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, and causes apoptosis/paraptosis-associated immunogenic cell death. After treatment, stressed and dying tumor cells can act as prophylactic or therapeutic cancer vaccines. In preclinical mouse models of cancers with intrinsic or acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade, the local administration of nanoassemblies inflames the immunologically silent TME and synergizes with ICB therapy, generating potent antitumor immunity. This chemically programmed small-molecule immune enhancer acts distinctly from regular cytotoxic therapeutics and offers a promising strategy for synchronous and dynamic tailoring of innate immunity to achieve traceless cancer therapy and overcome immunosuppression in cancers."}

The plastic TME, and the poor systemic tolerability of immune activating drugs are, however, fundamental barriers to generating curative anticancer immune responses. Here, we introduce the CarboCell technology to overcome these barriers by forming an intratumoral sustained drug release depot that provides high payloads of immune stimulatory drugs selectively within the TME. The CarboCell thereby induces a hot spot for immune cell training and polarization and further drives and maintains the tumor-draining lymph nodes in an anticancer and immune activated state. Mechanistically, this transforms cancerous tissues, consequently generating systemic anticancer immunoreactivity. CarboCell can be injected through standard thin-needle technologies and has inherent imaging contrast which secure accurate intratumoral positioning. In particular, here we report the therapeutic performance for a dual-drug CarboCell providing sustained release of a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist and a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 inhibitor in preclinical tumor models in female mice."}

Therefore, MCL1 is an attractive anticancer target. Here we describe BRD-810 as a potent and selective MCL1 inhibitor and its key design principle of rapid systemic clearance to potentially minimize area under the curve-driven toxicities associated with MCL1 inhibition. BRD-810 induced rapid cell killing within 4\u2009h in vitro but, in the same 4-h window, had no impact on cell viability or troponin I release in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, even at suprapharmacologic concentrations. In vivo BRD-810 induced efficacy in xenograft hematological and solid tumor models despite the short residence time of BRD-810 in plasma. In totality, our data support the hypothesis that short-term inhibition of MCL1 with BRD-810 can induce apoptosis in tumor cells while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. We, therefore, intend to advance BRD-810 to clinical trials."}

Central memory CD8+ T cells (TCM) play important roles in protection from chronic infection and cancer. Here we find, by single-cell RNA analysis of human breast cancer samples, that although the memory phenotype of peripheral CD8+ T cells increases slightly after microwave ablation (MWA), the metabolism of peripheral CD8+ T cells remains unfavorable for memory phenotype. In mouse models, glycolysis inhibition by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in combination with MWA results in long-term anti-tumor effect via enhancing differentiation of tumor-specific CD44hiCD62L+CD8+ TCM cells. Enhancement of CD8+ TCM cell differentiation determined by Stat-1, is dependent on the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) but takes place in peripheral blood, with metabolic remodeling of CD8+ T cells lasting the entire course of the the combination therapy. Importantly, in-vitro glycolysis inhibition in peripheral CD8+ T cells of patients with breast or liver tumors having been treated with MWA thrice leads to their differentiation into CD8+ TCM cells. Our work thus offers a potential strategy to avoid tumor recurrence following MWA therapy and lays down the proof-of-principle for future clinical trials."}

In cases of Enneking type II\u2009+\u2009III pelvic tumors, the prosthesis necessitates fixation to the remaining iliac bone. Prevailing methods for prosthesis fixation include the saddle prosthesis, ice cream prosthesis, modular hemipelvic prosthesis, and personalized prosthetics using three-dimensional printing. To prevent failure of hemipelvic arthroplasty protheses, a novel fixation method was designed and finite element analysis was conducted. In clinical cases, the third and fourth sacral screws broke, a phenomenon also observed in the results of finite element analysis. Based on the original surgical model, designs were created for auxiliary dorsal iliac, auxiliary iliac bottom, auxiliary sacral screw, and auxiliary pubic ramus fixation. A nonlinear quasi-static finite element analysis was then performed under the maximum load of the gait cycle, and the results indicated that assisted sacral dorsal fixation significantly reduces stress on the sacral screws and relative micromotion exceeding 28\u00a0\u03bcm. The fixation of the pubic ramus further increased the initial stability of the prosthesis and its interface osseointegration ability. Therefore, for hemipelvic prostheses, incorporating pubic ramus support and iliac back fixation is advisable, as it provides new options for the application of hemipelvic tumor prostheses."}

Patients were assigned to radioimmunotherapy if they had a complete or partial response, those with stable or progressive disease underwent surgery and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. Camrelizumab was maintained post-radioimmunotherapy. Fifty-one patients were enrolled with a median follow-up duration of 23.7 months. After induction therapy, the ORR was 82.4% (42/51), meeting the prespecified endpoint. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 26 patients, and no treatment-related death occurred. As three-year outcomes were immature, two-year OS, PFS and LPR were reported. As no distant metastatic event had occurred, MFS was not reported here. The two-year OS, PFS, and LPR rates were 83.0%, 77.1%, and 70.0%, respectively. The induction chemoimmunotherapy of camrelizumab plus TPF showed a high ORR rate with an acceptable safety profile in LA HSCC."}

Radiotherapy that encompassed the primary lesions and metastases commenced in the third cycle. The median progression-free survival time was 9.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8\u2013not estimable) in the intent-to-treat population, failing to meet the pre-specified primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints included an objective response rate of 45.5%, a disease control rate of 57.6%, and a median duration of response of 11.5 months (interquartile range, 6.4\u201315.0). The 1-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 41.9% (95% CI: 27.7\u201363.5) and 69.7% (95% CI: 55.7\u201387.3), respectively. Lymphopenia was the most frequent grade \u22653 adverse event (82%), and an esophageal fistula developed in three patients (9.1%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. In prespecified exploratory biomarker analysis, higher densities of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells, and CD68+ macrophages correlated with improved tumor response and prognosis. Radiotherapy supplementation to first-line chemo-immunotherapy for treatment-naive advanced ESCC demonstrated some antitumor activity and manageable safety profiles, warranting further randomized controlled trials."}

Lee", "Pashtoon Murtaza Kasi", "Ahmed O. Kaseb", "Hao Zhu"], "abstract": "Acquired resistance to systemic treatments is inevitable in most cancers, but the genetic basis for this in many cancer types has remained elusive due to constraints in obtaining tissue specimens longitudinally. In the management of gastrointestinal cancers, molecular profiling is conventionally performed at a single time point, although serial evaluations may yield biological insights that inform treatment decisions. We characterize genetic changes in serial liquid biopsies which provide real-time snapshots of tumor genetics and heterogeneity in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers, and determine the clinical utility of repeat circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing. In a national cohort of 449 patients with pancreatic, biliary, esophagogastric, and hepatocellular cancers, resistance to conventional therapies is broadly associated with tumor evolution. Emergent ctDNA alterations only detectable at progression occurs in 63% of patients and are frequently associated with treatment actionability. Tumor mutation burden is dynamic in cancers undergoing treatment, but is not associated with time to progression. Objective tumor responses in a case series of patients receiving treatment matched to emergent alterations show that repeat liquid biopsies may have clinical benefit by expanding treatment options in advanced gastrointestinal cancers."}

{"title": "Study on novel neutron irradiation without beam shaping assembly in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy", "published": "28 September 2024", "authors": ["Ant\u00f2nia Verdera", "Javier Praena"], "abstract": "Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is performed using high-intensity neutron sources; however, the energy of the primary neutrons is too high for direct patient irradiation. Thus, neutron moderation is mandatory and is performed using a device known as a Beam Shaping Assembly (BSA). Due to the differences in flux and energy spectra between neutron sources, each facility needs a dedicated BSA design, whether it is based on a nuclear reactor or, more recently, on an accelerator. Since moderation involves the loss of neutrons, typically by a factor of 1000, it is necessary to generate a very high flux before neutrons pass through the BSA. We propose a novel approach that eliminates the necessity of a BSA, BSA-free, by generating neutrons suitable in flux and energy for direct patient irradiation through the \\({}^{45}\\)Sc(p,n)\\({}^{45}\\)Ti reaction using near-threshold protons. Our findings demonstrate that all IAEA quality factors for BNCT can be met with existing proton accelerators. Additionally, figures of merit studied provide similar results compared to real BNCT facilities. This breakthrough opens up new avenues in BNCT, among others, the control of the neutron penetration within the human body by small changing in the proton energy. Also, it is expected simplified accelerator-based facilities in terms of manufacturing and maintenance and operation. This work is a study based on experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. Technical challenges and safety are addressed in Discussion section.\u00a0This novel proposal is under evaluation as patent. "}

Solute carrier (SLC) transporters are promising drug targets. Here, we identify SLC13A3 as a drug-targetable effector downstream of \u03b2-catenin in liver cancer. SLC13A3 expression is elevated in human liver cancer samples with gain of function (GOF) mutant CTNNB1, the gene encoding \u03b2-catenin. Activation of \u03b2-catenin up-regulates SLC13A3, leading to intracellular accumulation of endogenous SLC13A3 substrates. SLC13A3 is identified as a low-affinity transporter for glutathione (GSH). Silencing of SLC13A3 downregulates the leucine transporter SLC7A5 via c-MYC signaling, leading to leucine depletion and mTOR inactivation. Furthermore, silencing of SLC13A3 depletes GSH and induces autophagic ferroptosis in \u03b2-catenin-activated liver cancer cells. Importantly, both genetic inhibition of SLC13A3 and a small molecule SLC13A3 inhibitor suppress \u03b2-catenin-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Altogether, our study suggests that SLC13A3 could be a promising therapeutic target for treating human liver cancers with GOF CTNNB1 mutations."}

To overcome this limitation, we perform extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key stages in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues reveal that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling is a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Cell communication network and pathway analyses in GEMMs show that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogram the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to a convergence of cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that parallel key findings in human prostate cancer."}

Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 screening reveals that knockout of topoisomerase 1-binding arginine/serine-rich protein (TOPORS), which encodes a ubiquitin/SUMO E3 ligase, augments the efficacy of HMAs on myeloid leukemic cells with little effect on normal hematopoiesis, suggesting that TOPORS is involved in resistance to HMAs. HMAs are incorporated into the DNA and trap DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) to form DNA-DNMT1 crosslinks, which undergo SUMOylation, followed by proteasomal degradation. Persistent crosslinking is cytotoxic. The TOPORS RING finger domain, which mediates ubiquitination, is responsible for HMA resistance. In TOPORS knockout cells, DNMT1 is stabilized by HMA treatment due to inefficient ubiquitination, resulting in the accumulation of unresolved SUMOylated DNMT1. This indicates that TOPORS ubiquitinates SUMOylated DNMT1, thereby promoting the resolution of DNA-DNMT1 crosslinks. Consistently, the ubiquitination inhibitor, TAK-243, and the SUMOylation inhibitor, TAK-981, show synergistic effects with HMAs through DNMT1 stabilization. Our study provides a novel HMA-based therapeutic strategy that interferes with the resolution of DNA-DNMT1 crosslinks."}

However, the heterogeneous form of data and uneven distribution of targets make drug discovery and precision medicine a non-trivial task. This study takes pyroptosis therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a paradigm and uses data mining of a large TNBC cohort and drug databases to establish a biofactor-regulated neural network for rapidly screening and optimizing compound pyroptosis drug pairs. Subsequently, biomimetic nanococrystals are prepared using the preferred combination of mitoxantrone and gambogic acid for rational drug delivery. The unique mechanism of obtained nanococrystals regulating pyroptosis genes through ribosomal stress and triggering pyroptosis cascade immune effects are revealed in TNBC models. In this work, a target omics-based intelligent compound drug discovery framework explores an innovative drug development paradigm, which repurposes existing drugs and enables precise treatment of refractory diseases."}

Here we show that the TEAD transcription factors in the Hippo pathway are substrates of RNF214. RNF214 induces non-proteolytic ubiquitylation at a conserved lysine residue of TEADs, enhances interactions between TEADs and YAP, and promotes transactivation of the downstream genes of the Hippo signaling. Moreover, YAP and TAZ could bind polyubiquitin chains, implying the underlying mechanisms by which RNF214 regulates the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, RNF214 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and inversely correlates with differentiation status and patient survival. Consistently, RNF214 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and HCC tumorigenesis in mice. Collectively, our data reveal RNF214 as a critical component in the Hippo pathway by forming a signaling axis of RNF214-TEAD-YAP and suggest that RNF214 is an oncogene of HCC and could be a potential drug target of HCC therapy."}

Identifying risk factors for flap necrosis is essential for improving surgical outcomes and patient quality of life. A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent free flap reconstruction between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were included if they had comprehensive medical records and at least a six-month follow-up. We excluded those with a history of flap necrosis, uncontrolled systemic diseases, non-adherence to postoperative care, or concurrent malignancy treatments. Data on demographics, comorbidities, flap characteristics, and operative details were collected and analyzed using univariate analysis and logistic regression tests. Univariate analysis did not find a significant correlation between flap necrosis and factors such as hyperlipidemia, lymph node metastasis, or flap type. However, diabetes mellitus, oral infections, and albumin levels below 35\u00a0g/L were significantly associated with flap necrosis. Multivariate logistic regression showed diabetes mellitus increased the odds of flap necrosis by approximately ninefold, and oral infection increased it by over tenfold. Diabetes mellitus, oral infection, and low albumin levels are significant risk factors for flap necrosis in free flap reconstruction after oral and maxillofacial surgery. Prompt identification and management of these factors are crucial to mitigate the risk of flap necrosis."}

We retrospectively selected 3213 PTC patients treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2016 to 2020. They were randomly divided into the training and test datasets with a 7:3 ratio. The 533 PTC patients treated at the Guangyuan Central Hospital from 2019 to 2022 were used as an external test sets. We developed and validated nine ML models using 10-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The predictive performance was evaluated using ROC curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration curves, and precision-recall curves. The best model was compared to a traditional logistic regression-based nomogram. The XGBoost model achieved AUC values of 0.935, 0.857, and 0.775 in the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, significantly outperforming the traditional nomogram model with AUCs of 0.85, 0.844, and 0.769, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based visualization identified the top 10 predictive features of the XGBoost model, and a web-based calculator was created based on these features.

TKI are suspected of exacerbating muscle loss in patients with cancer. In this study, we analyze the role of muscle loss in patients with advanced HCC treated with lenvatinib. This is a retrospective analysis of a real-life cohort of 25 patients with advanced HCC who were treated with lenvatinib from 2018 to March 2021 in Germany. Patients were stratified for loss of skeletal muscle area during the first three months of lenvatinib therapy. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity were analyzed for all patients, especially regarding loss of muscle before and during the first three months of therapy with lenvatinib. Three months after beginning of therapy with lenvatinib, a significant reduction of muscle mass was observed in 60% of patients (p\u2009=\u20090.035). Despite increase of loss of skeletal muscle, patients benefitted from lenvatinib in our cohort of patients in terms of OS and PFS and did not experience increased toxicity. Furthermore, muscle loss was not a negative predictor of survival in the univariate analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.675). Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma experience muscle loss with lenvatinib therapy. However, despite progressive muscle loss, patients benefit from a therapy with lenvatinib in terms of OS and PFS without increased toxicity. However, assessment and prophylaxis of skeletal muscle status should be recommended during a therapy with lenvatinib."}

However, clinical benefits of radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations have been modest. Routine concomitant tumor-draining lymph node irradiation (DLN IR) might be the culprit. As crucial sites for generating anti-tumor immunity, DLNs are indispensable for the in situ vaccination effect of radiotherapy. Simultaneously, DLN sparing is often not feasible due to metastatic spread. Using murine models of metastatic disease in female mice, here we demonstrate that delayed (adjuvant), but not neoadjuvant, DLN IR overcomes the detrimental effect of concomitant DLN IR on the efficacy of radio-immunotherapy. Moreover, we identify IR-induced disruption of the CCR7-CCL19/CCL21 homing axis as a key mechanism for the detrimental effect of DLN IR. Our study proposes delayed DLN IR as a strategy to maximize the efficacy of radio-immunotherapy across different tumor types and disease stages."}

Because PD-1 receptor inhibition activates tumor-specific T-cell immunity, research has predominantly focused on T-cell-PD-1 expression and its immunobiology. In contrast, cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1 functional regulation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate induction of PD-1 in melanoma cells via type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling and reversal of ICB efficacy through IFNAR pathway inhibition. Treatment of melanoma cells with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 triggers IFNAR-mediated Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling, increases chromatin accessibility and resultant STAT1/2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) binding within a PD-1 gene enhancer, and leads to PD-1 induction. IFNAR1 or JAK/STAT inhibition suppresses melanoma-PD-1 expression and disrupts ICB efficacy in preclinical models. Our results uncover type I IFN-dependent regulation of cancer cell-PD-1 and provide mechanistic insight into the potential unintended ICB-neutralizing effects of widely used IFNAR1 and JAK inhibitors."}
{"title": "A systematic review on the techniques, long-term outcomes, and complications of partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer", "published": "27 September 2024", "authors": ["Jing Ning", "Guanghui Cheng", "Ning Wu"], "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of four techniques of partial breast irradiation (PBI) including interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT), balloon-based brachytherapy (BBT), Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) in the treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery. A systematic search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria were clinical trials and observational studies that reported on outcome measures of principal PBI techniques. The methodological quality of the included research data was assessed using bias risk assessment tool with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS), and the research information were analyzed using data analysis software. Clinical studies were collected from the earliest available date until September 2023. Fifty-one studies were included, with a total sample size of 7708. The results of network meta-analysis (NMA) showed that ISBT can lower the local recurrence (SUCRA: 73.8%). In terms of reducing distant metastasis, 3DCRT may be the best choice (SUCRA: 52.5%). And IORT has the highest 5-year overall survival (SUCRA: 90%). Furthermore, ISBT also has the advantages of lowest risk with fat necrosis (SUCRA: 72.5%), infection (SUCRA: 78.3%) and breast pain (SUCRA: 86.2%). BBT may be the optimal solution for fibrosis (SUCRA: 76.9%) and hyperpigmentation (SUCRA: 66.7%). 3DCRT has lower incidence of telangiectasia (SUCRA: 56.7%) and better cosmetic result (SUCRA: 85%). Postoperative PBI treatment using ISBT after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early-stage breast cancer may be a more valuable choice based on the treatment efficacy and is associated with fewer late side-effects. Large-scale, prospective, long-term studies are warranted to clarify the role of different PBI techniques in selected patients."}

In vitro microscopy methods are widely used for this task but typically require diluting the blood with a buffer to allow for transmission of light. However, whole blood provides crucial signaling cues that influence adhesion dynamics, which means that conventional approaches lack the full physiological complexity of living microvasculature. We can reliably image cell interactions in microfluidic channels during whole blood flow by motion blur microscopy (MBM) in vitro and automate image analysis using machine learning. MBM provides a low cost, easy to implement alternative to intravital microscopy, for rapid data generation where understanding cell interactions, adhesion, and motility is crucial. MBM is generalizable to studies of various diseases, including cancer, blood disorders, thrombosis, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as providing rich datasets for theoretical modeling of adhesion dynamics."}

The effects of GSL-targeted immunotherapies are not fully understood. Here, we show that the inhibition of GSL synthesis with the UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitor eliglustat can increase the exposure of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and tumour antigen peptides, enhancing the antitumour response of CD8+ T cells in a range of tumour models. We therefore conducted a proof-of-concept phase I trial on the combination of eliglustat and an anti-PD-1 antibody for the treatment of advanced cancers (NCT04944888). The primary endpoints were safety and feasibility, and the secondary endpoint was antitumor activity. All prespecified endpoints were met. Among the 31 enrolled patients, only 1 patient experienced a grade 3 adverse event (AE), and no grade 4 AEs were observed. The objective response rate was 22.6% and the disease control rate reached 71%. Of the 8 patients with proficient mismatch repair/microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) colorectal cancer, one achieved complete response and two each had partial response and stable disease. In summary, inhibiting the synthesis of GSLs might represent an effective immunotherapy approach."}

However, despite massive efforts, no specific therapy is currently available to target NRF2 hyperactivation. Here, we identify peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) is required for NRF2 protein stability. Ablation of PPIA promotes NRF2 protein degradation and blocks NRF2-driven growth in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, PPIA physically binds to NRF2 and blocks the access of ubiquitin/Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (KEAP1) to NRF2, thus preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Our X-ray co-crystal structure reveals that PPIA directly interacts with a NRF2 interdomain linker via a trans-proline 174-harboring hydrophobic sequence. We further demonstrate that an FDA-approved drug, cyclosporin A (CsA), impairs the interaction of NRF2 with PPIA, inducing NRF2 ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, CsA interrupts glutamine metabolism mediated by the NRF2/KLF5/SLC1A5 pathway, consequently suppressing the growth of NRF2-hyperactivated NSCLC cells. CsA and a glutaminase inhibitor combination therapy significantly retard tumor progression in NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with NRF2 hyperactivation. Our study demonstrates that targeting NRF2 protein stability is an actionable therapeutic approach to treat NRF2-hyperactivated NSCLC."}

However, direct evidence linking metabolic syndrome to TS-mediated LC progression remains to be established. Our findings demonstrate that 4-(methylnitrosamino)\u22121-(3-pyridyl)\u22121-butanone and benzo[a]pyrene (NNK and BaP; NB), components of tobacco smoke, induce metabolic syndrome characteristics, particularly hyperglycemia, promoting lung cancer progression in male C57BL/6\u2009J mice. NB enhances glucose uptake in tumor-associated macrophages by increasing the expression and surface localization of glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 and 3, thereby leading to transcriptional upregulation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which subsequently activates insulin receptor (IR) in LC cells in a paracrine manner, promoting its nuclear import. Nuclear IR binds to nucleophosmin (NPM1), resulting in IR/NPM1-mediated activation of the CD274 promoter and expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Restricting glycolysis, depleting macrophages, or blocking PD-L1 inhibits NB-mediated LC progression. Analysis of patient tissues and public databases reveals elevated levels of IGF2 and GLUT1 in tumor-associated macrophages, as well as tumoral PD-L1 and phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor (pIGF-1R/IR) expression, suggesting potential poor prognostic biomarkers for LC patients. Our data indicate that paracrine IGF2/IR/NPM1/PD-L1 signaling, facilitated by NB-induced dysregulation of glucose levels and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, contributes to TS-mediated LC progression."}

However, resistance to these therapies due to target absence or antigen shedding limits their efficacy and excludes tumours from candidacy. To address this limitation, here we engineer an oncolytic rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV\u039451), to express a truncated targeted antigen, which allows for HER2-targeting with trastuzumab. The truncated HER2 (HER2T) lacks signaling capabilities and is efficiently expressed on infected cell surfaces. VSV\u039451-mediated HER2T expression simulates HER2-positive status in tumours, enabling effective treatment with the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Additionally, we combine VSV\u039451-HER2T with an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a HER2-targeted T-cell engager. This dual-virus therapeutic strategy demonstrates potent curative efficacy in vivo in female mice using CD3+ infiltrate for anti-tumour immunity.

This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral center located in Korea to describe the relative frequency, demographics, survival outcomes, and temporal trend in PCL. A total of 627 PCL cases diagnosed between January 1994 and December 2022 were included. The majority of PCL cases (87.2%) were of T-/NK-cell lineage (CTCL), while the remaining cases (12.8%) were B-cell lineage lymphomas (CBCL). The prevalence of mycosis fungoides (MF) in CTCL increased significantly over time, while other CTCL subtypes, including primary cutaneous extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL), decreased in frequency. Notably, the prevalence of CD4-positive small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder showed a substantial increase over time. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma was consistently the commonest CBCL subtype. Survival analysis demonstrated that CTCL had a more favorable 5-year overall survival (OS) than CBCL. OS rate of MF, SPTCL, and primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS improved significantly over time. This study provides comprehensive insights into the dynamic change in the relative frequency and overall survival of PCL subtypes over time."}

We report selection, following initial CAR T cell infusion, of a clone with biallelic loss of BCMA acquired by deletion of one allele and a mutation that creates an early stop codon on the second allele. This loss leads to lack of CAR T cell proliferation following the second infusion and is reflected by lack of soluble BCMA in patient serum. Our analysis suggests the need for careful detection of BCMA gene alterations in multiple myeloma cells from relapse following CAR T cell therapy."}

This study examined these temporal changes in therapy with long-term outcomes in adult survivors of childhood glioma. Among 2,501 5-year survivors of glioma in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study diagnosed 1970\u20131999, exposure to radiation decreased over time. Survivors from more recent eras were at lower risk of late mortality (\u22655 years from diagnosis), severe/disabling/life-threatening chronic health conditions (CHCs) and subsequent neoplasms (SNs). Adjusting for treatment exposure (surgery only, chemotherapy, or any cranial radiation) attenuated this risk (for example, CHCs (1990s versus 1970s), relative risk (95% confidence interval), 0.63 (0.49\u20130.80) without adjustment versus 0.93 (0.72\u20131.20) with adjustment). Compared to surgery alone, radiation was associated with greater than four times the risk of late mortality, CHCs and SNs. Evolving therapy, particularly avoidance of cranial radiation, has improved late outcomes for childhood glioma survivors without increased risk for late recurrence."}

However, for patients who have not been genetically tested or lack BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCAm), this combination therapy has been questioned as a first-line conventional treatment for mCRPC, mainly due to significant health economics and side effects. In our retrospective study, we found that treatment with low-dose abiraterone plus olaparib as a late-line treatment for mCRPC could lead to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and symptom PFS in selective cases even without BRCAm. The median PSA\u2013PFS was 8\u00a0months (IQR: 6.5\u201311.5), with a median follow-up duration of 39.0\u00a0months (IQR: 27.5\u201364.5).

High-risk neuroblastoma is an aggressive pediatric solid tumor that expresses cell-surface GPC2 and GD2 with a tumor microenvironment infiltrated by CD16a-expressing innate immune cells. Here we engineer T-cells to express a GPC2-directed CAR and simultaneously secrete a bispecific innate immune cell engager (BiCE) targeting both GD2 and CD16a. In vitro, GPC2.CAR-GD2.BiCE T-cells induce GPC2-dependent cytotoxicity and secrete GD2.BiCE that promotes GD2-dependent activation of antitumor innate immunity. In vivo, GPC2.CAR-GD2.BiCE T-cells locally deliver GD2.BiCE and increase intratumor retention of NK-cells. In mice bearing neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts and reconstituted with human CD16a-expressing immune cells, GD2.BiCEs enhance GPC2.CAR antitumor efficacy. A CAR.BiCE strategy should be considered for tumor histologies where antigen escape limits CAR efficacy, especially for solid tumors like neuroblastoma that are infiltrated by innate immune cells."}

In a xenograft model of intracranial breast cancer, SG inhibited tumor growth and increased mouse survival. We conducted a prospective window-of-opportunity trial (NCT03995706) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio to examine the intra-tumoral concentrations and intracranial activity of SG in patients undergoing craniotomy for breast cancer with brain metastases (BCBM) or recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). We enrolled 25 patients aged \u226518 years diagnosed with BCBM and rGBM to receive a single intravenous dose of SG at 10\u2009mg/kg given one day before resection and continued on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles following recovery. The PFS was 8 months and 2 months for BCBM and rGBM cohorts, respectively. The OS was 35.2 months and 9.5 months, respectively. Grade\u22653 AE included neutropenia (28%), hypokalemia (8%), seizure (8%), thromboembolic event (8%), urinary tract infection (8%) and muscle weakness of the lower limb (8%). In post-surgical tissue, the median total SN-38 was 249.8\u2009ng/g for BCBM and 104.5\u2009ng/g for rGBM, thus fulfilling the primary endpoint. Biomarker analysis suggests delivery of payload by direct release at target site and that hypoxic changes do not drive indirect release. Secondary endpoint of OS was 35.2 months for the BCBM cohort and 9.5 months for rGBM. Non-planned exploratory endpoint of ORR was 38% for BCBM and 29%, respectively. Exploratory endpoint of Trop-2 expression was observed in 100% of BCBM and 78% of rGBM tumors. In conclusion, SG was found to be well tolerated with adequate penetration into intracranial tumors and promising preliminary activity within the CNS.

To address this issue, we established a cohort of 434 Chinese patients with HER2-low breast cancer (433 female and one male) and integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling data. In this cohort, HER2-low tumors are more distinguished from HER2-0 tumors in the hormone receptor\u2013negative subgroup. Within HER2-low tumors, significant interpatient heterogeneity also exists in the hormone receptor\u2013negative subgroup: basal-like tumors resemble HER2-0 disease, and non-basal-like HER2-low tumors mimic HER2-positive disease. These non-basal-like HER2-low tumors are enriched in the HER2-enriched subtype and the luminal androgen receptor subtype and feature PIK3CA mutation, FGFR4/PTK6/ERBB4 overexpression and lipid metabolism activation. Among hormone receptor\u2013positive tumors, HER2-low tumors show less loss/deletion in 17q peaks than HER2-0 tumors. In this work, we reveal the heterogeneity of HER2-low breast cancers and emphasize the need for more precise stratification regarding hormone receptor status and molecular subtype."}

This study investigated the heterogeneity of claudin 18.2 expression in 166 patients with metastatic GC whose surgical or paired primary\u2013metastatic specimens were available. The prevalence of claudin 18.2 positivity (moderate-to-strong expression in\u2009\u2265\u200975% by the 43-14A clone) was 47.0%. Claudin 18.2-positive tumors exhibited more frequent peritoneal metastasis and a lower incidence of hepatic and distant lymph node involvement. Survival outcomes were comparable between patients with claudin 18.2-positive and -negative tumors. Intratumoral heterogeneity was noted in 38.5% of surgical specimens. Paired primary-metastatic site analysis revealed that 25.2% of patients had discordant results for claudin 18.2 positivity. Across different metastatic organ categories, peritoneal lesions showed the highest positivity rate (44.3%) and positive concordance rate (31.4%), whereas liver lesions had the lowest positivity rate (17.9%) and concordance rate (12.8%). In conclusion,\u00a0claudin\u00a018.2 expression exhibits intratumoral and intrapatient spatial heterogeneity in metastatic GC. Claudin 18.2 positivity is associated with more frequent peritoneal metastasis, and peritoneal lesions are more likely to have positively concordant claudin 18.2 results with the primary site than other metastatic sites."}

Selective TKIs are approved for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with FGFR2 fusions; however, their application is limited by a characteristic pattern of adverse events or evocation of kinase domain mutations. A comprehensive characterization of a patient cohort treated with the non-selective TKI lenvatinib reveals promising efficacy in FGFR2-driven CCA. In a bed-to-bench approach, we investigate FGFR2 fusion proteins bearing critical tumor-relevant point mutations. These mutations confer growth advantage of tumor cells and increased resistance to selective TKIs but remain intriguingly sensitive to lenvatinib. In line with clinical observations, in-silico analyses reveal a more favorable interaction pattern of lenvatinib with FGFR2, including an increased flexibility and ligand efficacy, compared to FGFR-selective TKIs. Finally, the treatment of a patient with progressive disease and a newly developed kinase mutation during therapy with a selective inhibitor results in a striking response to lenvatinib. Our in vitro, in silico, and clinical data suggest that lenvatinib is a promising treatment option for FGFR2-driven CCA, especially when insurmountable adverse reactions of selective TKIs or acquired kinase mutations occur."}

Existing preclinical models lack true representation of this complexity. Using a Head and Neck cancer patient derived TruTumor histoculture platform, the response spectrum of 70 patients to anti-PD1 treatment is investigated in this study. With a subset of 55 patient samples, multiple assays to characterize T-cell reinvigoration and tumor cytotoxicity are performed. Based on levels of these two response parameters, patients are stratified into five sub-cohorts, with the best responder and non-responder sub-cohorts falling at extreme ends of the spectrum. The responder sub-cohort exhibits high T-cell reinvigoration, high tumor cytotoxicity with T-cells homing into the tumor upon treatment whereas immune suppression and tumor progression pathways are pre-dominant in the non-responders. Some moderate responders benefit from combination of anti-CTLA4 with anti-PD1, which is evident from better cytotoxic T-cell: T-regulatory cell ratio and enhancement of tumor cytotoxicity. Baseline and on-treatment gene expression signatures from this study stratify responders and non-responders in unrelated clinical datasets."}

We applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) ctDNA analysis to 218 samples from 65 patients receiving chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, including 28 patients receiving consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Patients with undetectable ctDNA after chemoradiation therapy had excellent outcomes whether or not they received consolidation ICI. Among such patients, one died from consolidation ICI-related pneumonitis, highlighting the potential utility of only treating patients with MRD. In contrast, patients with MRD after chemoradiation therapy who received consolidation ICI had significantly better outcomes than patients who did not receive consolidation ICI. Furthermore, the ctDNA response pattern early during consolidation ICI identified patients responding to consolidation therapy. Our results suggest that consolidation ICI improves outcomes for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with MRD and that ctDNA analysis may facilitate personalization of consolidation therapy."}

However, the existing literature on the role of adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to elucidate the correlation between obesity and cancer remains insufficient. Here, we aim to investigate the formation of cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) and their contribution to tumor growth using mouse models harboring dysfunctional adipocytes. Specifically, we employ adipocyte-specific BECN1 KO (BaKO) mice, which exhibit lipodystrophy due to dysfunctional adipocytes. Our results reveal the activation of YAP/TAZ signaling in both CAAs and BECN1-deficient adipocytes, inducing adipocyte dedifferentiation and formation of a malignant TME. The additional deletion of YAP/TAZ from BaKO mice significantly restores the lipodystrophy and inflammatory phenotypes, leading to tumor regression. Furthermore, mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibit decreased BECN1 and increased YAP/TAZ expression in their adipose tissues. Treatment with the YAP/TAZ inhibitor, verteporfin, suppresses tumor progression in BaKO and HFD-fed mice, highlighting its efficacy against mice with metabolic dysregulation. Overall, our findings provide insights into the key mediators of CAA and their significance in developing a TME, thereby suggesting a viable approach targeting adipocyte homeostasis to suppress cancer growth."}

Here, we comprehensively identify genes essential for survival of MYChigh but not MYClow cells by a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screen in a MYC-conditional HCC model. Our screen uncovers novel MYC synthetic lethal (MYC-SL) interactions and identifies most MYC-SL genes described previously. In particular, the screen reveals nucleocytoplasmic transport to be a MYC-SL interaction. We show that the majority of MYC-SL nucleocytoplasmic transport genes are upregulated in MYChigh murine HCC and are associated with poor survival in HCC patients. Inhibiting Exportin-1 (XPO1) in vivo induces marked tumor regression in an autochthonous MYC-transgenic HCC model and inhibits tumor growth in HCC patient-derived xenografts. XPO1 expression is associated with poor prognosis only in HCC patients with high MYC activity. We infer that MYC may generally regulate and require altered expression of nucleocytoplasmic transport genes for tumorigenesis."}

Preclinical studies and mouse models suggest that therapies targeting CD276 may outperform PD1/PD-L1 blockade. However, data from mouse models indicate a significant non-responsive population to anti-CD276 treatment, with the mechanisms of resistance still unclear. In this study, we evaluate the activity of anti-CD276 antibodies in a chemically-induced murine model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using models of induced and orthotopic carcinogenesis, we identify ITGB6 as a key gene mediating differential responses to anti-CD276 treatment. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and gene-knockout mouse models, we find that ITGB6 regulates the expression of the tumor-associated chemokine CX3CL1, which recruits and activates PF4+ macrophages that express high levels of CX3CR1. Inhibition of the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis suppresses the infiltration and secretion of CXCL16 by PF4+ macrophages, thereby reinvigorating cytotoxic CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells and enhancing sensitivity to anti-CD276 treatment. Further investigations demonstrate that inhibiting ITGB6 restores sensitivity to PD1 antibodies in mice resistant to anti-PD1 treatment. In summary, our research reveals a resistance mechanism associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and identifies potential targets to overcome resistance in cancer treatment."}

Post-pubertal (type II) malignant GCTs may present as seminoma, non-seminoma or mixed histologies. In contrast, pre-pubertal (type I) GCTs are limited to (benign) teratoma and (malignant) yolk sac tumor (YST). Epidemiologic and molecular data have shown that pre- and post-pubertal GCTs arise by distinct mechanisms. Dedicated studies of the genomic landscape of type I and II GCT in children and adolescents are lacking. Here we present an integrated genomic analysis of extracranial GCTs across the age spectrum from 0\u201324 years. Activation of the WNT pathway by somatic mutation, copy-number alteration, and differential promoter methylation is a prominent feature of GCTs in children, adolescents and young adults, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Significantly, we find that small molecule WNT inhibitors can suppress GCT cells both in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the importance of WNT pathway signaling in GCTs across all ages and provide a foundation for future efforts to develop targeted therapies for these cancers."}

Our results demonstrate that brain metastases \u22643\u2009cm are not uniformly responsive to SRS and suggest that prospective studies to evaluate the effect of SRS alone or in combination with surgery on brain metastases \u22643\u2009cm matched by tumor size and histology are warranted. These studies will help establish multi-disciplinary treatment guidelines that improve local control while minimizing radiation necrosis during treatment of brain metastasis \u22643\u2009cm."}

Among the 172 AML patients analysed, 48.3% (n\u2009=\u200983) were females. Median age was 31.5\u00a0years (range 14 to 62\u00a0years), two patients was more than 60\u00a0years old (1.2%). Median follow-up was 44\u00a0months (range 1 to 94\u00a0months). According to the AML-DRG model, 109, 49 and 14 patients were in low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively. According to the AML-HCT-CR model, 108, 30, 20 and 14 patients were in low-, intermediate-, high- and very high-risk group, respectively. Our results showed that the AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR models significantly predicted cumulative incidence of relapse (p\u2009<\u20090.001; p\u2009<\u20090.001). But AML-DRG model was not associated with NRM (p\u2009=\u20090.072). Univariate analysis showed that the AML-DRG model could better stratify AML patients into different risk groups compared to the AML-HCT-CR model. Multivariate analysis confirmed that prognostic impact of AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR models on post-transplant OS was independent to age, sex, conditioning type, transplant modality, and stem cell source (p\u2009<\u20090.001; p\u2009<\u20090.001). AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR models can be used to effectively predict post-transplant survival in patients with AML receiving AHCT. Compared to AML-HCT-CR score, the AML-DRG score allows better stratification and improved survival prediction of AML patients post-transplant."}

We compared rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC between BRCA1/2 variant carriers and noncarriers in a cohort of 1426 women (92 [6.5%] BRCA1 and 73 [5.1%] BRCA2) with clinical stage I\u2013III breast cancer treated with NAC followed by surgery from 11/2013 to 01/2022 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The majority received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel therapy (93%); BRCA1/2 carriers were more likely to receive carboplatin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Overall, pCR was achieved in 42% of BRCA1 carriers, 21% of BRCA2 carriers, and 26% of noncarriers (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Among clinically node-positive (cN+) patients, nodal pCR was more frequent in BRCA1/2 carriers compared to noncarriers (53/96 [55%] vs. 371/856 [43%], p\u2009=\u20090.015). This difference was seen in HR+/HER2\u2212 (36% vs. 20% of noncarriers; p\u2009=\u20090.027) and TN subtypes (79% vs. 45% of noncarriers; p\u2009<\u20090.001). In a multivariable analysis of the overall cohort, BRCA1 status, and TN and HER2+ subtypes were independently associated with pCR. These data indicate that BRCA1 carriers may be more likely to achieve overall and nodal pCR in response to NAC compared with BRCA2 carriers and patients with sporadic disease. Further studies with a larger cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are needed, as a small sample size may have a restricted ability to detect a significant association between mutational status and pCR in sensitivity analyses stratified by subtype and adjusted for clinically relevant factors."}

However, the relationship between the TME, usually characterized by immune cell density, and response to ICI is unclear. Here, we quantify the TME immune cell densities and spatial relationships (SRs) of 24 baseline UC samples, obtained before pre-operative combination ICI treatment, using multiplex immunofluorescence. We describe SRs by approximating the first nearest-neighbor distance distribution with a Weibull distribution and evaluate the association between TME metrics and ipilimumab+nivolumab response. Immune cell density does not discriminate between response groups. However, the Weibull SR metrics of CD8+ T cells or macrophages to their closest cancer cell positively associate with response. CD8+ T cells close to B cells are characteristic of non-response. We validate our SR response associations in a combination ICI cohort of head and neck tumors. Our data confirm that SRs, in contrast to density metrics, are strong biomarkers of response to pre-operative combination ICIs."}

Before surgery, all patients underwent both plain and contrast-enhanced chest CT scans. Two clinical characteristics, fifteen plain CT characteristics, and four enhanced characteristics were used to develop two logistic regression models: model 1 (plain CT only) and model 2 (plain\u2009+\u2009contrast CT). The diagnostic performance of the two models was assessed separately in the development and external validation cohorts using the AUC. 392 patients from Center A were\u00a0included\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0training cohort (median size, 20.0 [IQR, 15.0\u201324.0] mm; mean age, 55.8 [SD, 9.9] years; male, 53.3%). 135 patients from Center B were\u00a0included in the external validation cohort (median size, 20.0 [IQR, 16.0\u201324.0] mm; mean age, 56.4 [SD, 9.6] years; male, 51.9%).

Therefore, we aimed to construct a nomogram to predict PR, and establish PR score for risk stratification to guide adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 315 patients with gastric cancer after radical surgery were included, and randomly stratified into training group (n\u2009=\u2009221) and validation group (n\u2009=\u200994). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine predictive factors of PR. The nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of PR. We utilized the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor site, N stage, preoperative CEA, and postoperative CA199 were independent predictors of PR. A nomogram was constructed to predict PR based on these factors. The AUC value was 0.755 in the training group and 0.715 in the validation group. The calibration curves showed good agreement between prediction and observation in the training and validation groups. The decision curve analysis displayed a good net benefit of the nomogram. The novel PR score was developed and patients were stratified into the low-, medium-, and high -risk groups. For the high-risk group, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved patients' overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The establishment of nomogram facilitates the prediction of PR after radical gastrectomy, and a novel PR score may help guide adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer."}

Here, we show that combining ATR inhibition (ATRi) with radiotherapy (RT) increases the frequency of activated NKG2A+PD-1+ T cells in animal models of HNSCC. Compared with the ATRi/RT treatment regimen alone, the addition of simultaneous NKG2A and PD-L1 blockade to ATRi/RT, in the adjuvant, post-radiotherapy setting induces a robust antitumour response driven by higher infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells in the tumour microenvironment. The efficacy of this combination relies on CD40/CD40L costimulation and infiltration of activated, proliferating memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with persistent or new T cell receptor (TCR) signalling, respectively. We also observe increased richness in the TCR repertoire and emergence of numerous and large TCR clonotypes that cluster based on antigen specificity in response to NKG2A/PD-L1/ATRi/RT. Collectively, our data point towards potential combination approaches for the treatment of HNSCC."}

Our study aims to develop a model based on multimodal MRI by using radiomics and deep learning to predict the treatment response in CC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). From August 2009 to June 2013, CC patients in stage Ib2-IIb (FIGO 2008) who received NACRT at Fujian Cancer Hospital were enrolled in our study. Clinical information, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) data were respectively collected. Radiomic features and deep abstract features were extracted from the images using radiomics and deep learning models, respectively. Then, ElasticNet and SVM-RFE were employed for feature selection to construct four single-sequence feature sets. Early fusion of two multi-sequence feature sets and one hybrid feature set were performed, followed by classification prediction using four machine learning classifiers. Subsequently, the performance of the models in predicting the response to NACRT was evaluated by separating patients into training and validation sets. Additionally, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Among the four machine learning models, SVM exhibited the best predictive performance (AUC=0.86). Among the seven feature sets, the hybrid feature set achieved the highest values for AUC (0.86), ACC (0.75), Recall (0.75), Precision (0.81), and F1-score (0.75) in the validation set, outperforming other feature sets. Furthermore, the predicted outcomes of the model were closely associated with patient OS and DFS (p = 0.0044; p = 0.0039). A model based on MRI images with features from multiple sequences and different methods could precisely predict the response to NACRT in CC patients. This model could assist clinicians in devising personalized treatment plans and predicting patient survival outcomes."}

Part A demonstrated increased CelTIL score after one dose of HER3-DXd. Here we report CelTIL score and safety for Part B. In addition, the exploratory analyses of part A involve a comprehensive study of gene expression, somatic mutations, copy-number segments, and DNA-based subtypes, while Part B focuses on validating gene expression. RNA analyses show significant correlations between CelTIL responses, high proliferation genes (e.g., CCNE1, MKI67), and low expression of luminal genes (e.g., NAT1, SLC39A6). DNA findings indicate that CelTIL response is significantly associated with TP53 mutations, proliferation, non-luminal signatures, and a distinct DNA-based subtype (DNADX\u00a0cluster-3). Critically, low HER2DX\u00a0ERBB2 mRNA, correlates with increased HER3-DXd activity, which is validated through in vivo patient-derived xenograft\u00a0 models.

We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of intracranial meningiomas operated between 2007 and 2018. Recurrence within 5\u00a0years after Simpson Grade I-III resection was considered as early. Preoperative T1 CE MRI sequences were analysed conventionally by two radiologists. Additionally a semantic feature score based on systematic analysis of morphological characteristics was developed and a radiomic analysis were performed. For the radiomic model, tumour volume was extracted manually, 791 radiomic features were extracted. Eight feature selection algorithms and eight machine learning methods were used. Models were analysed using test and training datasets. In total, 226 patients were included. There were 21% CNS WHO grade 2 tumours, no CNS WHO grade 3 tumour, and 25 (11%) tumour recurrences were detected in total. In ROC analysis the best radiomic models demonstrated superior performance for determination of CNS WHO grade (AUC 0.930) and early recurrence (AUC 0.892) in comparison to the semantic feature score (AUC 0.74 and AUC 0.65) and conventional radiological analysis (AUC 0.65 and 0.54). The combination of human classifiers, semantic score and radiomic analysis did not markedly increase the model performance.

For the exploratory endpoint of DFS in each arm of the trial, three-year DFS was 63% (95% CI: 46.0\u201380.4) in the durvalumab monotherapy arm compared to 67% (95% CI: 49.6\u201383.4) in the dual therapy arm. In addition, we report post hoc exploratory analysis of progression-free survival as well as molecular correlates of response and recurrence through high-plex immunophenotyping of sequentially collected peripheral blood and gene expression profiles from resected tumors in both treatment arms. Together, our results contribute to the evolving landscape of neoadjuvant treatment regimens for NSCLC and identify easily measurable potential biomarkers of response and recurrence."}

However, the toxicity profile of immune-chemotherapy combination treatment approaches among older adult cancer patients is still unclear. Patients with any cancer who received camrelizumab-based immunotherapy were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoints were adverse events (AEs) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which were defined based on Naranjo's algorithm. Patients were stratified by age (\u2265\u200970\u00a0years and <\u200970\u00a0years), and comparisons were made based on the type of camrelizumab-based therapy (monotherapy, combined chemotherapy, or combined anti-VEGF therapy). A total of 185 patients were administered camrelizumab-based immunotherapy, 55 (30%) of whom were \u2265\u200970\u00a0years old. A total of 146 (78.9%) patients received camrelizumab-based combination treatment. The incidence of all-grade AEs was 56.8% (105 patients), while that of irAEs was 36.8% (68 patients). There was no difference in the percentage of patients experiencing any grade or grade \u2265\u20093 AEs between age groups. However, the frequency of irAEs (both any grade and grade \u2265\u20093) significantly differed by age group (P\u2009=\u20090.001 and 0.009, respectively). The results of multivariable analysis revealed that age \u2265\u200970\u00a0years was the only independent risk factor for irAEs. The results of subgroup analysis revealed that the incidence of irAEs was higher in older patients treated with camrelizumab-chemotherapy, while the incidence rates were similar between age groups in the monotherapy and combination anti-VEGF treatment subgroups. Immune-related diabetes mellitus occurred more frequently among older adults. The spectrum of irAEs showed that combination immunotherapy had more widely effects on the organ system than monotherapy. In this study, older (\u2265\u200970\u00a0years) patients had a higher risk of all-grade and high-grade irAEs when receiving camrelizumab chemotherapy combination treatment. Notably, long-term random glucose monitoring should be performed during ICI-based immunotherapy in older cancer patients."}

To address this shortcoming, we perform multi-region sequencing on paired random bone marrow and focal lesion samples from 17 newly diagnosed patients. Using single-cell RNA- and ATAC-seq we find a median of 6 tumor subclones per patient and unique subclones in focal lesions. Genetically identical subclones display different levels of spatial transcriptional plasticity, including nearly identical profiles and pronounced heterogeneity at different sites, which can include differential expression of immunotherapy targets, such as CD20 and CD38. Macrophages are significantly depleted in the microenvironment of focal lesions. We observe proportional changes in the T-cell repertoire but no site-specific expansion of T-cell clones in intramedullary lesions. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the relevance of considering spatial heterogeneity in multiple myeloma with potential implications for models of cell-cell interactions and disease progression."}

In our multi-institutional study of 394 NSCLC patients, we utilize pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to establish a habitat imaging framework for assessing regional heterogeneity within individual tumors. This framework identifies three PET/CT subtypes, which maintain prognostic value after adjusting for clinicopathologic risk factors including tumor volume. Additionally, these subtypes complement ctDNA in predicting disease recurrence. Radiogenomics analysis unveil the molecular underpinnings of these imaging subtypes, highlighting downregulation in interferon alpha and gamma pathways in the high-risk subtype. In summary, our study demonstrates that these habitat imaging subtypes effectively stratify NSCLC patients based on their risk levels for disease recurrence after initial curative surgery or radiotherapy, providing valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches."}

To date, selectivity assessment has been limited to peptide library screening and predictive modeling. We developed an experimental platform to de novo identify interactomes of TCR-like antibodies directly in human tissues using mass spectrometry. As proof of concept, we confirm the target epitope of a MAGE-A4-specific TCR-like antibody. We further determine cross-reactive peptide\u00a0sequences for ESK1, a TCR-like antibody with known off-target activity, in human liver tissue. We confirm off-target-induced T cell activation and ESK1-mediated liver spheroid killing. Off-target sequences feature an amino acid motif that allows a structural groove-coordination mimicking that of the target peptide, therefore allowing the interaction with the engager molecule. We conclude that our strategy offers an accurate, scalable route for evaluating the non-clinical safety profile of TCR-like antibody therapeutics prior to first-in-human clinical application."}

Several immune- and tumor intrinsic features are associated with clinical response at baseline. However, we need to further understand the molecular changes occurring during development of ICB resistance. Here, we collect biopsies from a cohort of 44 patients with melanoma after progression on anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 monotherapy. Genetic alterations of antigen presentation and interferon gamma signaling pathways are observed in approximately 25% of ICB resistant cases. Anti-CTLA4 resistant lesions have a sustained immune response, including immune-regulatory features, as suggested by multiplex spatial and T cell receptor (TCR) clonality analyses. One anti-PD1 resistant lesion harbors a distinct immune cell niche, however, anti-PD1 resistant tumors are generally immune poor with non-expanded TCR clones. Such immune poor microenvironments are associated with melanoma cells having a de-differentiated phenotype lacking expression of MHC-I molecules. In addition, anti-PD1 resistant tumors have reduced fractions of PD1+ CD8+ T cells as compared to ICB na\u00efve metastases. Collectively, these data show the complexity of ICB resistance and highlight differences between anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 resistance that may underlie differential clinical outcomes of therapy sequence and combination."}

The multi-classifier system demonstrates significantly higher predictive accuracy for recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to the three single classifiers alone in the training set and in both validation sets (C-index 0.831-0.858 vs. 0.642-0.777, p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing from patient tumors, patient-derived xenografts, primary in vitro cultures, and cell lines, we identify four dominant muscle-lineage cell states: progenitor, proliferative, differentiated, and ground cells. We stratify these RMS cells/nuclei along the continuum of human muscle development and show that they share expression patterns with fetal/embryonal myogenic precursors rather than postnatal satellite cells. Fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) have a discrete stem cell hierarchy that recapitulates fetal muscle development and contain therapy-resistant FN-RMS progenitors that share transcriptomic similarity with bipotent skeletal mesenchymal cells. Fusion-positive RMS have tumor-acquired cells states, including a neuronal cell state, that are not found in myogenic development. This work identifies previously underappreciated cell state heterogeneity including unique treatment-resistant and tumor-acquired cell states that differ across RMS subtypes."}

A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the SEER database. Patients with cT2N0 MS-SCC were included in the study and divided into two groups: those who received END and those who did not. The impact of END on disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using propensity score matching. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors for occult metastasis. A total of 180 patients were included in the study, with 40 cases receiving END. Following propensity score matching, patients treated with END and those without showed similar DSS and OS rates. Occult metastasis was observed in 9 patients, corresponding to a rate of 22.5%. High-grade tumors were independently associated with a higher risk of occult metastasis compared to low-grade tumors (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.17\u20132.00). cT2 MS-SCC carries an occult metastasis rate of 22.5%, with histologic grade being the primary determinant of occult metastasis. END does not confer a significant survival benefit in this patient population."}

Here, we combine dual PD-L1 and VEGFA blockade (DPVB) with low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT), which rapidly inflames tumors, rendering them vulnerable to immunotherapy. The combinatorial therapy exhibits superior antitumor efficacy mediated by CD8+ T cells in various preclinical HCC models. Treatment efficacy relies upon mobilizing exhausted-like CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tex) with effector function and cytolytic capacity. Mechanistically, LDRT sensitizes tumors to DPVB by recruiting stem-like CD8+ Tpex, the progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells, from draining lymph nodes (dLNs) into the tumor via the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis. Together, these results further support the rationale for combining LDRT with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, and its clinical translation."}

ARHGAP25 is down-regulated in a variety of solid tumors and promotes cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. However, nothing is understood about ARHGAP25\u2019s biological function in osteosarcoma. This work used qPCR and WB to confirm the expression of ARHGAP25 in osteosarcoma following the initial analysis of its expression in pan-cancer. For GO and KEGG analysis, we have chosen 300 genes from the TARGET osteosarcoma data that had the strongest positive correlation with ARHGAP25, and we created nomogram and calibration charts. We simultaneously overexpressed ARHGAP25 in osteosarcoma cells to examine its impact on apoptosis and proliferation. By using MSP, we determined their methylation status in osteosarcoma cells and normal bone cells. We observed that ARHGAP25 was significantly downregulated in a range of malignancies, including osteosarcoma, and was associated with poor patient outcomes. The decrease of ARHGAP25 expression in osteosarcoma is related to DNA methylation. Overexpression of ARHGAP25 induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. In addition, ARHGAP25 is also associated with immune-related pathways in osteosarcoma. These findings suggest that ARHGAP25 is a valuable prognostic biomarker in osteosarcoma patients."}

While it is clear that cancer cells can have the capacity to alter immune landscapes, our understanding of this process is incomplete. Herein we show that endocytic trafficking at the plasma membrane, mediated by the small GTPase ARF6, enables melanoma cells to impose an immunosuppressive TME that accelerates tumour development. This ARF6-dependent TME is vulnerable to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) but in murine melanoma, loss of Arf6 causes resistance to ICB. Likewise, downregulation of ARF6 in patient tumours correlates with inferior overall survival after ICB. Mechanistically, these phenotypes are at least partially explained by ARF6-dependent recycling, which controls plasma membrane density of the interferon-gamma receptor. Collectively, our findings reveal the importance of endomembrane trafficking in outfitting tumour cells with the ability to shape their immune microenvironment and respond to immunotherapy."}

These disadvantages are further compounded by tumor heterogeneity, especially the presence of cancer stem-like cells, which drive tumor growth and relapse. Herein, we design a region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform that integrates both reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activatable and hypoxia-responsive PROTAC prodrugs for the precise manipulation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 expression and tumor eradication. These PROTAC nanoparticles selectively accumulate within and penetrate deep into tumors via response to matrix metalloproteinase-2. Photoactivity is then reactivated in response to the acidic intracellular milieu and the PROTAC is discharged due to the ROS generated via photodynamic therapy specifically within the normoxic microenvironment. Moreover, the latent hypoxia-responsive PROTAC prodrug is restored in hypoxic cancer stem-like cells overexpressing nitroreductase. Here, we show the ability of region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform to effectively degrade BRD4 in both normoxic and hypoxic environments, markedly hindering tumor progression in breast and head-neck tumor models."}

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) may affect breast cancer metastasis by regulating alternative splicing (AS) during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesised that during EMT development in breast cancer cells, the expression level of RBPs and the gene AS pattern in the cell were significantly changed on a genome-wide scale. Using GEO database, this study identified differentially expressed RBPs and differential AS events at different stages of EMT in breast cancer cells. By establishing the correlation network of differential RBPs and differential AS events, we found that RBM47, PCBP3, FRG1, SRP72, RBMS3 and other RBPs may regulate the AS of ITGA6, ADGRE5, TNC, COL6A3 and other cell adhesion genes. By further analysing above EMT-related RBPs and AS in breast cancer tissues in TCGA, it was found that the expression levels of ADAT2, C2orf15, SRP72, PAICS, RBMS3, APOBEC3G, NOA1, ACO1 and the AS of TNC and COL6A3 were significantly correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients. The expression levels of all 8 RBPs were significantly different in breast cancer tissues without metastasis compared with normal breast tissues. Conclusively, eight RBPs such as RBMS3 and AS of TNC and COL6A3 could be used as predictors of breast cancer prognosis. These findings need to be further explored as possible targets for breast cancer treatment."}

Here, we identify methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) as a critical driver of the androgen-indifferent state in ERG fusion-positive CRPC. MAT2A is upregulated in CRPC and cooperates with ERG in promoting cell plasticity, stemness and tumorigenesis. RNA, ATAC and ChIP-sequencing coupled with histone post-translational modification analysis by mass spectrometry show that MAT2A broadly impacts the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape. MAT2A enhances H3K4me2 at multiple genomic sites, promoting the expression of pro-tumorigenic non-canonical AR target genes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MAT2A reverses the transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling in CRPC models and improves the response to AR and EZH2 inhibitors. These data reveal a role of MAT2A in epigenetic reprogramming and provide a proof of concept for testing MAT2A inhibitors in CRPC patients to improve clinical responses and prevent treatment resistance."}

Among 547 clinical cN2a NSCLC patients, 118 (21.6%), 58 (10.6%), and 371 (67.8%) had pN0, pN1, and pN2. Among 371 pN2 NSCLC patients, 77 (20.8%), 165 (44.5%), and 129 (34.7%) had pN2a1, pN2a2, and pN2b.

The risk scoring system based on this model demonstrated good discriminant ability for pN2b disease (area under receiver operating characteristic: 0.779). In cN2a NSCLC patients, those with multiple N2 metastases indicate worse prognosis than those with a single N2 metastasis. Our risk scoring system effectively predicts pN2b in these patients."}

Pyroptosis mediated by GSDME, but not the canonical GSDMD, is activated in myocardial tissue of mice and cancer patients with ICI-induced myocarditis. Deficiency of GSDME in male mice alleviates ICI-induced cardiac infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as mitochondrial damage and inflammation. Restoration of GSDME expression specifically in cardiomyocytes, rather than myeloid cells, in GSDME-deficient mice reproduces ICI-induced myocarditis. Mechanistically, quantitative proteomics reveal that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis promotes cell death and mitochondrial DNA release, which in turn activates cGAS-STING signaling, triggering a robust interferon response and myocardial immune/inflammation activation. Pharmacological blockade of GSDME attenuates ICI-induced myocarditis and improves long-term survival in mice. Our findings may advance the understanding of ICI-induced myocarditis and suggest that targeting the GSDME-cGAS-STING-interferon axis may help prevent and manage ICI-associated myocarditis."}

Although enteric glia modulate immune responses in other intestinal diseases, their interaction with the colorectal cancer immune cell compartment remains unclear. Through a combination of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, both in murine models and patients, here we find that enteric glia acquire an immunomodulatory phenotype by bi-directional communication with tumor-infiltrating monocytes. The latter direct a reactive enteric glial cell phenotypic and functional switch via glial IL-1R signaling. In turn, tumor glia promote monocyte differentiation towards pro-tumorigenic SPP1+ tumor-associated macrophages by IL-6 release. Enteric glia cell abundancy correlates with worse disease outcomes in preclinical models and colorectal cancer patients. Thereby, our study reveals a neuroimmune interaction between enteric glia and tumor-associated macrophages in the colorectal tumor microenvironment, providing insights into colorectal cancer pathogenesis."}

However, it\u2019s unclear whether homologous recombination (HR) status-dependent glycosylation can be therapeutically explored. Here, we show that the inhibition of branched N-glycans sensitizes HR-proficient, but not HR-deficient, epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). In contrast to fucosylation whose inhibition sensitizes EOCs to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy regardless of HR-status, we observe an enrichment of branched N-glycans on HR-proficient compared to HR-deficient EOCs. Mechanistically, BRCA1/2 transcriptionally promotes the expression of MGAT5, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing branched N-glycans. The branched N-glycans on HR-proficient tumors augment their resistance to anti-PD-L1 by enhancing its binding with PD-1 on CD8+ T cells. In orthotopic, syngeneic EOC models in female mice, inhibiting branched N-glycans using 2-Deoxy-D-glucose sensitizes HR-proficient, but not HR-deficient EOCs, to anti-PD-L1. These findings indicate branched N-glycans as promising therapeutic targets whose inhibition sensitizes HR-proficient EOCs to ICB by overcoming immune evasion."}

A class of RASG12C (ON) inhibitors that targets active GTP-bound KRASG12C blocks ERK signaling more potently than the inactive-state inhibitors. Sensitivity to either class of agents is strongly correlated with inhibition of mTORC1 activity. We have previously shown that PI3K/mTOR and ERK-signaling pathways converge on key cellular processes and that inhibition of both pathways is required for inhibition of these processes and for significant antitumor activity. We find here that the combination of a KRASG12C inhibitor with a selective mTORC1 kinase inhibitor causes synergistic inhibition of Cyclin D1 expression and cap-dependent translation. Moreover, BIM upregulation by KRASG12C inhibition and inhibition of MCL-1 expression by the mTORC1 inhibitor are both required to induce significant cell death. In vivo, this combination causes deep, durable tumor regressions and is well tolerated. This study suggests that the ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways each mitigate the effects of inhibition of the other and that combinatorial inhibition is a potential strategy for treating KRASG12C-dependent lung cancer."}

Furthermore, we analyzed the cfDNA methylomes of 215 samples from individuals with liver or brain cancer and individuals without cancer (controls), and trained machine learning models using DMRs, DHMRs or both. The models incorporated with both DMRs and DHMRs show a superior performance compared to models trained with DMRs or DHMRs, with AUROC being 0.978, 0.990, and 0.983 in distinguishing control, liver and brain cancer, respectively, in a validation cohort.

It is the most common type of melanoma in individuals with dark skin and is notoriously challenging to treat. We examine exome sequencing data of 139 tissue samples, spanning different progression stages, from 37 patients. We find that 78.4% of the melanomas display clustered copy number transitions with focal amplifications, recurring predominantly on chromosomes 5, 11, 12, and 22. These complex genomic aberrations are typically shared across all progression stages of individual patients. TERT activating alterations also arise early, whereas MAP-kinase pathway mutations appear later, an inverted order compared to the canonical evolution. The punctuated formation of complex aberrations and early TERT activation suggest a unique mutational mechanism that initiates acral melanoma. The marked intratumoral heterogeneity, especially concerning MAP-kinase pathway mutations, may partly explain the limited success of therapies for this melanoma subtype."}

The persistent low HDL-C group increases the risk of gastric, liver, and biliary cancer comparing to persistent normal HDL-C group. HDL-C change from normal to low level increases the risk for gastric, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, gallbladder, and biliary cancers. Effects of HDL-C change on the gastrointestinal cancer risk are also modified by sex and smoking status. HDL-C changes affect the gastric and gallbladder cancer risk in age \u226560 years and the pancreatic and biliary cancer risk in age <60 years. Here, we show persistently low HDL-C and normal-to-low HDL-C change increase gastrointestinal cancer risk with discrepancies by sex, smoking status, and age."}

This paper seeks to devise and validate a predictive model based on clinical parameters for the early anticipation of high-volume CLNM (hv-CLNM,\u2009>\u20095 nodes) in high-risk patients.\u00a0A retrospective analysis of the pathological and clinical data of patients with PTC who underwent surgical treatment at Medical Centers A and B was conducted. The data from Center A was randomly divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio, with those from Center B serving as the test set. Multifactor logistic regression was harnessed in the training set to select variables and construct a predictive model. The generalization ability of the model was assessed in the validation and test sets. The model was evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) to predict the efficiency of hv-CLNM. The goodness of fit of the model was examined via the Brier verification technique.\u00a0The incidence of hv-CLNM in 5897 PTC patients attained 4.8%. The occurrence rates in males and females were 9.4% (128/1365) and 3.4% (156/4532), respectively. Multifactor logistic regression unraveled male gender (OR\u2009=\u20092.17, p\u2009<\u2009.001), multifocality (OR\u2009=\u20094.06, p\u2009<\u2009.001), and lesion size (OR\u2009=\u20091.08 per increase of 1\u00a0mm, p\u2009<\u2009.001) as risk factors, while age emerged as a protective factor (OR\u2009=\u20090.95 per an increase of 1\u00a0year, p\u2009<\u2009.001). The model constructed with four predictive variables within the training set exhibited an AUC of 0.847 ([95%CI] 0.815\u20130.878). In the validation and test sets, the AUCs were 0.831 (0.783\u20130.879) and 0.845 (0.789\u20130.901), respectively, with Brier scores of 0.037, 0.041, and 0.056. Subgroup analysis unveiled AUCs for the prediction model in PTC lesion size groups (\u2264\u200910\u00a0mm and\u2009>\u200910\u00a0mm) as 0.803 (0.757\u20130.85) and 0.747 (0.709\u20130.785), age groups (\u2264\u200931\u00a0years and\u2009>\u200931\u00a0years) as 0.778 (0.720\u20130.881) and 0.837 (0.806\u20130.867), multifocal and solitary cases as 0.803 (0.767\u20130.838) and 0.809 (0.769\u20130.849), and Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (HT) and non-HT cases as 0.845 (0.793\u20130.897) and 0.845 (0.819\u20130.871). Male gender, multifocality, and larger lesion size are risk factors for hv-CLNM in PTC patients, whereas age serves as a protective factor. The clinical predictive model developed in this research facilitates the early identification of high-risk patients for hv-CLNM, thereby assisting physicians in more efficacious risk stratification management for PTC patients."}

Recent studies have reported that the use of ligamentum teres hepatis (LTH) in LPD may reduce the risk of PPH. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether wrapping the hepatic hilar artery with the LTH can reduce PPH after LPD. We reviewed the data of 131 patients who underwent LPD in our team from April 2018 to December 2023. The patients were divided into Groups A (60 patients) and B (71 patients) according to whether the hepatic portal artery was wrapped or not. The perioperative data of the two groups were compared to evaluate the effect of LTH wrapping the hepatic hilar artery on LPD. The platelet count of Group A was (225.25\u2009\u00b1\u200987.61)\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L, and that of Group B was (289.38\u2009\u00b1\u2009127.35)\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L, with a statistically significant difference (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The operation time of group A [300.00 (270.00, 364.00)] minutes was shorter than that of group B [330.00 (300.00, 360.00)] minutes, p\u2009=\u20090.037. In addition, A set of postoperative hospital stay [12.00 (10.00, 15.00)] days shorter than group B [15.00 (12.00, 19.50)] days, p\u2009<\u20090.001. No PPH occurred in Group A, while 8 patients in Group B had PPH (7 cases of gastroduodenal artery hemorrhage and 1 case of proper hepatic artery hemorrhage), p\u2009=\u20090.019. The new technique of wrapping the hepatic hilar artery through the LTH can effectively reduce the occurrence of PPH after LPD."}

Here, we conduct whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on 460 cfDNA samples from patients with non-metastatic ESCC or precancerous lesions and matched healthy controls. We develop an expanded multimodal analysis (EMMA) framework to simultaneously identify cfDNA methylation, copy number variants (CNVs), and fragmentation markers in cfDNA WGBS data. cfDNA methylation markers are the earliest and most sensitive, detectable in 70% of ESCCs and 50% of precancerous lesions, and associated with molecular subtypes and tumor microenvironments. CNVs and fragmentation features show high specificity but are linked to late-stage disease. EMMA significantly improves detection rates, increasing AUCs from 0.90 to 0.99, and detects 87% of ESCCs and 62% of precancerous lesions with >95% specificity in validation cohorts. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal analysis of cfDNA methylome for early detection and monitoring of molecular characteristics in ESCC."}

Sarma", "Corinne Abbadie", "Fabrizio Cleri"], "abstract": "The DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair pathway is initiated by the multifunctional enzyme PARP-1, which recognizes the broken DNA ends by its two zinc-finger domains, Zn1 and Zn2. Despite a number of experiments performed with different DNA configurations and reduced fragments of PARP-1, many details of this interaction that is crucial to the correct initiation of the repair chain are still unclear. We performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) computer simulations of the interaction between the Zn1/Zn2 domains of PARP-1 and a DNA hairpin including a missing nucleotide to simulate the presence of an SSB, a construct used in recent experiments. The role of Zn1 and Zn2 interacting with the SSB ends is studied in detail, both independently and cooperatively. We also explored, PARP-1 operating as a dimer, with the two Zn-fingers coming from two separate copies of the enzyme. By an extensive set of all-atom molecular simulations employing state-of-the art force fields, assisted by empirical docking and free-energy calculations, we conclude that the particular conformation of the DNA hairpin can indeed spontaneously open up by thermal fluctuations, up to extremely kinked deformations. However, such extreme localized deformations are rarely observed in free, long DNA fragments. Protein side-loops make contact with the DNA hairpin grooves, and help Zn2 to penetrate deep in the SSB gap. In this way, Zn2 can interact with the nucleotides opposite to the missing base. Overall, Zn1 plays a secondary role: the crucial factor for the interaction is rather the relative arrangement of the Zn1/Zn2 couple, and their mutual orientation with respect to the \\(3'\\) and \\(5'\\) SSB end terminals. This helps to obtain an early interacting configuration, which ultimately leads to molecular PARP-1-DNA structures similar to those observed experimentally. Such findings represent an important step toward defining the detailed function of PARP-1 in the early stages of SSB recognition."}

Among 288 trials with comparisons of survival, outcome, or response, 16% report males having statistically significant better survival outcome or response, while 42% reported significantly better survival outcome or response for females. The strongest differences are in trials of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer and rituximab in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (both favoring females). Among 44 trials with side effect comparisons, more trials report significantly lesser side effects in males (N\u2009=\u200922) than in females (N\u2009=\u200913). Thus, while statistical comparisons between sexes in oncology trials are rarely reported, important differences in outcome and toxicity exist.

Targeting membranous phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3\u201311.3 months). Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response. These results suggest that targeting phosphatidylserine may lead to synergistic effects with PD-1 blockade without increasing toxicity rates, and future studies on this therapeutic strategy may be guided by biomarkers characterizing the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment."}

Durable clinical responses were observed in both the anti-TIGIT(three of six participants) and the anti-LAG3 (two of six participants) arms. Anti-LAG3 responders had higher naive cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)-positive T cells and lower programmed cell death protein 1-positive effector T cells.

The mechanisms governing the balance between proliferation and differentiation in MBEN remain poorly understood. Here, we employ a multi-modal single cell transcriptome analysis to dissect this process. In the internodular compartment, we identify proliferating cerebellar granular neuronal precursor-like malignant cells, along with stromal, vascular, and immune cells. In contrast, the nodular compartment comprises postmitotic, neuronally differentiated malignant cells. Both compartments are connected through an intermediate cell stage resembling actively migrating CGNPs. Notably, we also discover astrocytic-like malignant cells, found in proximity to migrating and differentiated cells at the transition zone between the two compartments. Our study sheds light on the spatial tissue organization and its link to the developmental trajectory, resulting in a more benign tumor phenotype. This integrative approach holds promise to explore intercompartmental interactions in other cancers with varying histology."}

Here, we leveraged a rare study of surgical intervention in 43 de novo metastatic prostate cancers to assess somatic genotypes across 607 synchronous primary and metastatic tissue regions plus circulating tumor DNA. Intra-prostate heterogeneity was pervasive and impacted clinically relevant genes, resulting in discordant genotypes between select primary restricted regions and synchronous metastases. Additional complexity was driven by polyclonal metastatic seeding from phylogenetically related primary populations. When simulating clinical practice relying on a single tissue region, genomic heterogeneity plus variable tumor fraction across samples caused inaccurate genotyping of dominant disease; however, pooling extracted DNA from multiple biopsy cores before sequencing can rescue misassigned somatic genotypes. Our results define the relationship between synchronous treatment-sensitive primary and metastatic lesions in men with de novo metastatic prostate cancer and provide a framework for implementing genomics-guided patient management."}

A previously observed relationship between MPB and skin cancer may be due to greater exposure to ultraviolet radiation or indicate a role for androgenic pathways in the pathogenesis of skin cancers. We dissected this relationship via Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, using genetic data from recent male-only meta-analyses of cutaneous melanoma (12,232 cases; 20,566 controls) and keratinocyte cancers (KCs) (up to 17,512 cases; >100,000 controls), followed by stratified MR analysis by body-sites. We found strong associations between MPB and the risk of KC, but not with androgens, and multivariable models revealed that this relationship was heavily confounded by MPB single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in pigmentation pathways. Site-stratified MR analyses revealed strong associations between MPB with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, suggesting that sun exposure on the scalp, rather than androgens, is the main driver. Men with less hair covering likely explains, at least in part, the higher incidence of melanoma in men residing in countries with high ambient UV."}

Eligible patients who had been histologically proven AGC with T3/4NxM0 stage are randomly assigned (1:1) to either surgery alone or surgery plus EIPL. The results of the two groups are analyzed in the intent-to-treat population. A total of 662 patients with AGC (329 patients in the surgery alone group, and 333 in the surgery plus EIPL group) are included in the study. The primary endpoint is 3-year overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints include 3-year disease free survival (DFS), 3-year peritoneal recurrence-free survival (reported in this manuscript) and 30-day postoperative complication and mortality (previously reported). The trial meets pre-specified endpoints. Estimated 3-year OS rates are 68.5% in the surgery alone group and 70.6% in the surgery plus EIPL group (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.77). 3-year DFS rates are 61.2% in the surgery alone group and 66.0% in the surgery plus EIPL group (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.24). The pattern of disease recurrence is similar in the two groups. In conclusion, EIPL does not improve the 3-year survival rate in AGC patients."}

Our results show that the antitumor activity of the experimental intermittent schedule of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib is not superior to the standard continuous schedule. Detection of BRAF mutation in cell free tumor DNA has prognostic value for survival and its dynamics has an excellent correlation with clinical response, but not with progression. NGS analysis demonstrated de novo mutations in resistant cases."}

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbors high transcriptomic intratumor heterogeneity (RNA-ITH) that limits the reproducibility of expression-based prognostic models. In this study, we used multiregional RNA-seq data (880 tumor samples from 350 individuals) from both public (TRACERx) and internal (MDAMPLC) cohorts to investigate the effect of RNA-ITH on prognosis in localized NSCLC at the gene, signature, and tumor microenvironment levels. At the gene level, the maximal expression of hazardous genes (expression negatively associated with survival) but the minimal expression of protective genes (expression positively associated with survival) across different regions within a tumor were more prognostic than the average expression. Following that, we examined whether multiregional expression profiling can improve the performance of prognostic signatures. We investigated 11 gene signatures collected from previous publications and one signature developed in this study. For all of them, the prognostic prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by converting the regional expression of signature genes into sample-specific expression with a simple function\u2014taking the maximal expression of hazardous genes and the minimal expression of protective genes. In the tumor microenvironment, we found a similar rule also seems applicable to immune ITH. We calculated the infiltration levels of major immune cell types in each region of a sample based on expression deconvolution. Prognostic analysis indicated that the region with the lowest infiltration level of protective or highest infiltration level of hazardous immune cells determined the prognosis of NSCLC patients. Our study highlighted the impact of RNA-ITH on the prognostication of NSCLC, which should be taken into consideration to optimize the design and application of expression-based prognostic biomarkers and models. Multiregional assays have the great potential to significantly improve their applications to prognostic stratification."}

Differences between responders and nonresponders were identified at the time of leukapheresis. Nonresponders showed an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by increased numbers of monocytes expressing the immune checkpoint molecule CD39 and suppressed CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell function. Analysis of CAR T cells showed cytotoxic and exhausted phenotypes in hyperexpanded clones compared to low/intermediate expanded clones. We identified potential immunotherapy targets on CAR T cells, like PD1, to improve their functionality and durability. Our work provides evidence that an immunosuppressive microenvironment causes resistance to CAR T cell therapies in multiple myeloma."}

Therefore, this study aimed to establish the association between WBRT and the development of lymphopenia in patients with brain metastases undergoing brain radiotherapy (RT), along with evaluating the corresponding clinical outcomes. Including 116 patients with brain metastases undergoing brain radiotherapy, the study collected the absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) within 2\u00a0weeks before brain radiotherapy (pre-radiotherapy, pre-RT), as well as ones at 1 and 2\u00a0months after completing RT (post-RT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify associations between radiation modality and post-RT ALC. The relationships between post-RT ALC and overall survival were evaluated with Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and a multivariate Cox regression model. The median ALC definitely decreased at 1\u00a0month post-RT, but at 2\u00a0months post-RT, gradually rose but not to the pre-RT ALC. The multivariate analysis identified WBRT and lower pre-RT ALC as independent risk factors associated with the decrease in post-RT ALC at 1\u00a0month. It also revealed more than 4 brain metastases, G3-4 lymphopenia at 1\u00a0month and lower post-RT ALC at 2\u00a0months exhibited significantly worse prognosis regardless of the radiation modality. However, there was indeed an independent correlation between radiation modality and the outcome of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). To approach the feasibility and reasonableness of treatment, clinicians should carefully consider various factors to achieve long-term survival of patients."}

The tumor microenvironment (TME) and its components, namely tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), play a pivotal role in ICT resistance; however, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. In this study, we identify expression of TNF-Stimulated Factor 6 (TSG-6) in ICT-resistant pancreatic tumors, compared to ICT-sensitive melanoma tumors, both in mouse and human. TSG-6 is expressed by CAFs within the TME, where suppressive macrophages expressing Arg1, Mafb, and Mrc1, along with TSG-6 ligand Cd44, predominate. Furthermore, TSG-6 expressing CAFs co-localize with the CD44 expressing macrophages in the TME. TSG-6 inhibition in combination with ICT improves therapy response and survival in pancreatic tumor-bearing mice by reducing macrophages expressing immunosuppressive phenotypes and increasing CD8 T cells. Overall, our findings propose TSG-6 as a therapeutic target to enhance ICT response in non-responsive tumors."}

Current radiomic signatures suffer from limited reproducibility and generalizability, because most features are dependent on imaging modality and tumour histology, making them sensitive to variations in scan protocol. Here, we propose novel radiological features that are specially designed to ensure compatibility across diverse tissues and imaging contrast. These features provide systematic characterization of tumour morphology and spatial heterogeneity. In an international multi-institution study of 1,682 patients, we discover and validate four unifying imaging subtypes across three malignancies and two major imaging modalities. These tumour subtypes demonstrate distinct molecular characteristics and prognoses after conventional therapies. In advanced lung cancer treated with immunotherapy, one subtype is associated with improved survival and increased tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with the others. Deep learning enables automatic tumour segmentation and reproducible subtype identification, which can facilitate practical implementation. The unifying radiological tumour classification may inform prognosis and treatment response for precision medicine."}

However, little is known about the precise function and consequences of PHF6 in MN. Here we show three main findings in our comprehensive genomic and proteomic study. Firstly, we show a different pattern of genes correlating with PHF6MT in male and female cases. When analyzing male and female cases separately, in only male cases, RUNX1 and U2AF1 are co-mutated with PHF6. In contrast, female cases reveal co-occurrence of ASXL1 mutations and X-chromosome deletions with PHF6MT. Next, proteomics analysis reveals a direct interaction between PHF6 and RUNX1. Both proteins co-localize in active enhancer regions that define the context of lineage differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate a negative prognostic role of PHF6MT, especially in association with RUNX1. The negative effects on survival are additive as PHF6MT cases with RUNX1 mutations have worse outcomes when compared to cases carrying single mutation or wild-type."}

Both immunogenomic analyses and diagnostic platforms to distinguish candidates and predict good responders to these IR-related agents are vital in clinical pathology. By applying an automated single-cell count for immunolabelled LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT, we reveal that individual IR levels with exclusive domination in each tumour can serve as valid biomarkers for profiling human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We uncover the immunogenomic landscape associated with individual IR levels in human RCC tumours with metastases in various organs and histological subtypes. We then externally validate our results and devise a workflow with optimal biomarker cut-offs for discriminating the LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT tumour profiles. The discrimination of LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT profiles in tumours may have a broad impact on investigations of immunotherapy responses after targeting a new series of IRs."}

Using the UK Biobank data, we prospectively investigate the associations between adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) or a Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MINDDiet) and the risk of overall and 22 specific cancers, as well as the mediating effects of metabolites. Here we show significant negative associations of MedDiet and MINDDiet adherence with overall cancer risk. These associations remain robust across 14 and 13 specific cancers, respectively. Then, a sequential analysis, incorporating Cox regression, elastic net and gradient boost models, identify 10 metabolites associated with overall cancer risk. Mediation results indicate that these metabolites play a crucial role in the association between adherence to a MedDiet or a MINDDiet and cancer risk, independently and cumulatively. These findings deepen our understanding of the intricate connections between diet, metabolites, and cancer development."}

We both confirm the results of exome studies, and also uncover previously undescribed sex differences. These include sex-biases in coding and non-coding cancer drivers, mutation prevalence and strikingly, in mutational signatures related to underlying mutational processes. These results underline the pervasiveness of molecular sex differences and strengthen the call for increased consideration of sex in molecular cancer research."}

Patients with clinical stage I lung cancer at our institution between 2007 and 2016 were identified (N\u2009=\u20091111). Exclusions included\u2009<\u200918\u00a0years of age (N\u2009=\u20092), missing stage or demographics (N\u2009=\u200956), incomplete appointment data or had only one scheduled appointment (N\u2009=\u2009351), or did not survive for at least 1\u00a0year after diagnosis (N\u2009=\u2009120). Missed appointments were defined as unattended follow-up appointments within the first year of diagnosis without an attended appointment in the subsequent 60\u00a0days. The primary outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) for death associated per 10% increase in missed oncology follow-up appointments. Univariable and descriptive statistics were performed, and a multivariable landmark Cox regression model was created to examine the effect of missed oncology follow-up on survival. A total of 582 patients were analyzed with median follow-up of 3.2\u00a0years and median age of 69\u00a0years. On multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, race, insurance status, and definitive treatment type the HR for death was 1.44 (95% CI 1.05\u20131.97) for every 10% increase in missed appointments. Incomplete oncologic follow-up may negatively impact overall survival among survivors of early-stage lung cancer."}

Research has shown that sleep patterns significantly influence tumor onset and progression. In this research, the association was examined through the application of a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. For the analysis of seven sleep patterns, genetic tools were sourced from both the UK Biobank and 23andMe, including morning/evening person (chronotype) n\u2009=\u2009177,604, morning person (chronotype) n\u2009=\u2009248,094, daytime dozing/sleepiness n\u2009=\u2009193,472, getting up in the morning n\u2009=\u2009193,717, and sleeplessness n\u2009=\u2009193,987; sleep duration n\u2009=\u2009192,810; and nap during the day n\u2009=\u2009166,853. The Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) supplied genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data, including 133,384 breast cancer cases and 113,789 controls, alongside subtype-specific data with 106,278 cases and 91,477 controls. We discovered that chronotype encompasses both morning and evening types contributes to the risk of overall breast cancer. While daytime dozing and morning person (chronotype) are linked to a lower risk of breast cancer in general, In subtype-specific analyses, morning person (chronotype) was negatively associated with luminal B, HER2-negative-like, and daytime dozing was negatively correlated with luminal A-like, luminal B-like, and HER2-enriched-like. The study corroborates that chronotype is a danger element for breast cancer, aligning with previous observational findings. The association between being a morning person (chronotype) or having daytime dozing and a decreased risk of breast cancer underscores the significance of sleep patterns in formulating strategies for cancer prevention."}

We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of new patients seen at the Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center dating from 5/2015 to 9/2021, which included 3043 patients screened for breast CCTs. We compared the rate of CCT availability, eligibility, and enrollment between two patient populations: Smith Clinic, where most patients are of low SES and uninsured, and Baylor St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center (BSLMC) with mostly predominantly insured, higher income patients. We performed logistic regression to evaluate whether differences in age, clinic, race, trial type, and primary language may be underlying the differences in CCT enrollment. More patients were eligible for CCTs at Smith Clinic (53.7% vs 44.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, Smith Clinic patients were more likely to decline CCT enrollment compared to BSLMC (61.3% declined vs 39.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). On multivariate analysis, Black patients had a significantly higher rate of CCT refusal overall (OR\u2009=\u20090.26, 95% CI 0.12\u20130.56, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and BSLMC only (OR\u2009=\u20090.20, 95% CI 0.060\u20130.60, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Our data shows that it is likely an oversimplification to assume that equal access will lead to the elimination of CCT disparities. Efforts to diversify CCTs must include consideration of structural and institutional inequities as well as social needs."}

We retrospectively collected CRC patients who underwent radical surgery from Jan 2011 to Jan 2020 in a single-center hospital. The patients were divided into the high LNR group and the low group according to the median. The baseline information and the short-term outcomes were compared between the high group and the low group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze the independent predictors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A 1:1 proportional propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the selection bias between the two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to estimate the OS and DFS between the two groups in different T stages. A total of 1434 CRC patients undergoing radical surgery were enrolled in this study, and there were 730 (50.9%) patients in the low LNR group and 704 (49.1%) patients in the high LNR group. After the PSM, there were 618 patients in both groups, the baseline characteristics between the two groups had no significant difference (p\u2009>\u20090.05).

The high LNR group had a worse OS in T3 (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and T4 (p\u2009<\u20090.01) as well as a worse DFS in T3 (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and T4 (p\u2009<\u20090.01). No association was found between LNR and postoperative complications, but the high LNR group had a longer hospital stay. LNR was identified as an independent predictor for OS and DFS. Furthermore, high LNR had a worse OS and DFS under T3 and T4 stages. Therefore, LNR was more prognostically significant for CRC patients under T3 and T4 stages."}

Yet, despite a high initial remission rate, CAR-T therapy ultimately fails for some patients. Notably, around half of relapsing patients develop CD19 negative (CD19neg) B-ALL allowing leukemic cells to evade CD19-targeted therapy. Herein, we investigate leukemic cells of a relapsing B-ALL patient, at two-time points: before (T1) and after (T2) anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment. We show that at T2, the B-ALL relapse is CD19 negative due to the expression of a non-functional CD19 transcript retaining intron 2. Then, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) approach, we demonstrate that CD19neg leukemic cells were present before CAR-T cell therapy and thus that the relapse results from the selection of these rare CD19neg B-ALL clones. In conclusion, our study shows that scRNAseq profiling can reveal pre-existing CD19neg subclones, raising the possibility to assess the risk of targeted therapy failure."}

It is possible that the H2S synthase cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE), which has been previously shown to promote tumour growth and metastasis in other cancer cells, is involved in this resistance. Therefore, we investigated CSE's role and potential mechanisms in TAM-resistant breast cancer cells. First, we examined the effect of CSE expression on TAM sensitivity and resistance in MCF7 (breast cancer) cells. The findings revealed that CSE was directly associated with TAM sensitivity and involved in TAM resistance in ER+\u2009breast cancer cells, indicating that it may be useful as a biomarker. Next, we wanted to determine the molecular mechanism of CSE's role in TAM resistance. Using cell migration, co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and cell viability assays, we determined that the CSE/H2S system can affect the expression of PPAR\u03b3 by promoting the sulfhydrylation of PPAR\u03b3, which regulates the transcriptional activity of ACSL1. ACSL1, in turn, influences STAT3 activation by affecting the phosphorylation, palmitoylation and dimerization of STAT3, ultimately leading to the development of TAM resistance in breast cancer. Finally, we examined the effect of CSE inhibitors on reducing drug resistance to determine whether CSE may be used as a biomarker of TAM resistance. We observed that the novel CSE inhibitor I194496 can reverse TAM resistance in TAM-resistant breast cancer via targeting the PPAR\u03b3/ACSL1/STAT3 signalling pathway. Overall, our data indicate that CSE may serve as a biomarker of TAM resistance and that the CSE inhibitor I194496 is a promising candidate for combating TAM resistance."}

Pathway activity differences in metabolic adaptation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and DNA repair were characterized between these diseases. PBL showed upregulation of Wnt-CTNNB1 and IGF2 pathways. Seventeen ACC-specific proteins suggested connections to metabolic diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction, while 34 PBL-specific proteins marked this pediatric cancer with an embryonic stem cell phenotype and alterations in chromosomal proteins and the cell cycle. This study provides novel insights into the proteomic landscapes of ACC and PBL, offering potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic development."}

NEOTAX was a phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant toripalimab plus axitinib in patients with ccRCC and IVC-TT (ChiCTR2000030405). The primary endpoint was the down-staging rate of IVC-TT level. Secondary endpoints included change in TT length, response rate, percentage change in surgical approach, surgical morbidity, progression-free survival (PFS), safety, and biomarker analyses. In all, 25 patients received study treatment, 44.0% (11/25) patients had a reduction in thrombus level, and none experienced an increase in Mayo level. The median change in tumor thrombus length was \u22122.3\u2009cm (range: \u22127.1 to 1.1\u2009cm). Overall, 61.9% (13/21) patients experienced changes in surgical strategy compared with planned surgery, three patients experienced major complications. The median PFS was 25.3 months (95% CI: 17.0-NE). The 1-year PFS was 89.1% (95% CI: 62.7\u201397.2). No any of grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse event was identified. Biopsy samples of non-responders exhibited increased T cytotoxic cell infiltration, but these cells were predominantly PD-1 positive. Biopsy samples of responders exhibited lower T helper cells, however, their subtype, regulatory T cells remained unchanged. In surgical samples of the TT, non-responders exhibited increased CD8T_01_GZMK_CXCR4 subset T cells. NEOTAX met preset endpoints proving that toripalimab in combination with axitinib downstages IVC-TT in a significant proportion of patients leading to simplification in the procedure of surgery."}

To better understand this resistance, we comprehensively profile 100 human uveal melanoma metastases using clinicogenomics, transcriptomics, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte potency assessment. We find that over half of these metastases harbor tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with potent autologous tumor specificity, despite low mutational burden and resistance to prior immunotherapies. However, we observe strikingly low intratumoral T cell receptor clonality within the tumor microenvironment even after prior immunotherapies. To harness these quiescent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, we develop a transcriptomic biomarker to enable in vivo identification and ex vivo liberation to counter their growth suppression. Finally, we demonstrate that adoptive transfer of these transcriptomically selected tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can promote tumor immunity in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma when other immunotherapies are incapable."}

We used deep learning to obtain an optimal convolutional neural network (CNN) by adequately annotating data for oral exfoliative cytology considering labels from multiple oral pathologists. Six whole-slide images were processed using QuPath for segmenting them into tiles. The images were labeled by three oral pathologists, resulting in 14,535 images with the corresponding pathologists\u2019 annotations. Data from three pathologists who provided the same diagnosis were labeled as ground truth (GT) and used for testing. We investigated six models trained using the annotations of (1) pathologist A, (2) pathologist B, (3) pathologist C, (4) GT, (5) majority voting, and (6) a probabilistic model. We divided the test by cross-validation per slide dataset and examined the classification performance of the CNN with a ResNet50 baseline. Statistical evaluation was performed repeatedly and independently using every slide 10 times as test data. For the area under the curve, three cases showed the highest values (0.861, 0.955, and 0.991) for the probabilistic model. Regarding accuracy, two cases showed the highest values (0.988 and 0.967). For the models using the pathologists and GT annotations, many slides showed very low accuracy and large variations across tests. Hence, the classifier trained with probabilistic labels provided the optimal CNN for oral exfoliative cytology considering diagnoses from multiple pathologists. These results may lead to trusted medical artificial intelligence solutions that reflect diverse diagnoses of various professionals."}

Early detection of ovarian cancer has significant diagnostic value. In response to the problem of poor diagnostic performance of traditional early diagnosis methods, this article designed an automated early ovarian cancer detection system to improve the detection of early ovarian cancer. The conventional early diagnosis methods include serum CA125 (carbohydrate antigen 125) detection and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. This article combined serum CA125 detection and PET/CT imaging to detect the CA125 level and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) in patient\u2019s serum. When the CA125 level exceeded 35U/ml and the maximum SUV value exceeded 2.5, the test was considered positive. This article selected 200 patients from Jingzhou Hospital for the experiment and compared the three detection methods. The average specificity of single serum CA125 detection, single PET/CT imaging, and automated detection in patients under 50 were 61.24%, 79.57%, and 97.79%, respectively. The automated early ovarian cancer detection system designed in this article can significantly improve the specificity of early ovarian cancer detection and has excellent application value for early ovarian cancer detection."}

Here, we use summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a Mendelian randomisation (MR) phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify potentially causal relationships for over 3,000 traits. Our outcome datasets comprise 378,142 cases across breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, endometrial, oesophageal, renal, and ovarian cancers, as well as 485,715 controls. We complement this analysis by systematically mining the literature space for supporting evidence. In addition to providing supporting evidence for well-established risk factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, lack of physical activity), we also find sex steroid hormones, plasma lipids, and telomere length as determinants of cancer risk. A number of the molecular factors we identify may prove to be potential biomarkers. Our analysis, which highlights aetiological similarities and differences in common cancers, should aid public health prevention strategies to reduce cancer burden. We provide a R/Shiny app to visualise findings."}

Here we report the activity of CHK1i in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with measurable and biopsiable disease (cohort 5), or without biopsiable disease (cohort 6). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes were safety and progression-free survival (PFS). 49 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled (24 in cohort 5, 25 in cohort 6). Among the 39 RECISTv1.1-evaluable patients, ORR was 33.3% in cohort 5 and 28.6% in cohort 6. Primary endpoint was not evaluable due to early stop of the trial. The median PFS was 4\u00a0months in cohort 5 and 6\u00a0months in cohort 6. Toxicity was manageable. Translational research was an exploratory endpoint. Potential biomarkers were investigated using pre-treatment fresh biopsies and serial blood samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed high levels of DNA replication-related genes (POLA1, POLE, GINS3) associated with lack of clinical benefit [defined post-hoc as PFS <\u00a06 months]. Subsequent preclinical experiments demonstrated significant cytotoxicity of POLA1 silencing in combination with CHK1i in platinum-resistant HGSOC cell line models. Therefore, POLA1 expression may be predictive for CHK1i resistance, and the concurrent POLA1 inhibition may improve the efficacy of CHK1i monotherapy in this hard-to-treat population, deserving further investigation."}

A total of 1250 symptomatic women who attended the gynaecology outpatient department of the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and Nalanda Medical College, Patna, for pap smear examinations were screened and recruited for the study. Due to highly clinical symptoms out of the negative with inflammatory smears reported, one hundred and ten patients were randomly advised for biopsy and HPV 16/18 DNA analysis by a gynaecologist to correlate negative smears included in the study.\u00a0Pap smear reports revealed that 1178 (94.24%) were negative for intraepithelial lesions (NILM) with inflammatory smears, 23 (1.84%) smears showed low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 12 (0.96%) smears showed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 37 (2.96%) smears showed an atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASC-US). A biopsy of 110 out of 1178 (NILM) patients revealed that 15 (13.63%) women had cervical cancer, 29 women had CIN I, 17 women had CIN II\u2009+\u2009CIN III, 35 women had benign cervical changes, and 14 women had haemorrhages. On the other hand, HPV 16/18 DNA was detected as positive in 87 out of 110. The high positivity of HPV in biopsied cases where frank cervical cancer and at-risk cancer were also observed in the negative smear-screened patients reveals that the HPV status and clinical history of the patients will be quite helpful to the cytologist for accurate reporting, and suggests that a negative HPV DNA result may be a stronger predictor of cervical cancer risk than a negative Pap test."}

The models\u2019 performance was rigorously validated against 2054 samples from two independent cohorts. In addition to classic metrics of model performance, we compared the robustness of the three models to reduced tumor purity, a critical consideration in the clinical utility of such classifiers.

Target genes of BBR were sifted through TargetNet, CTD, SwissTargetPrediction, and Binding Database. Based on the GSE183795 dataset, DEG analysis, GSEA, and WGCNA were sequentially run to build a disease network. Through sub-network filtration acquired PDAC-related hub genes. A PPI network was established using the shared genes. Degree algorithm from cytoHubba screened the key cluster in the network. Analysis of differential mRNA expression and ROC curves gauged the diagnostic performance of clustered genes. CYBERSORT uncovered the potential role of the key cluster on PDAC immunomodulation. ScRNA-seq analysis evaluated the distribution and expression profile of the key cluster at the single-cell level, assessing enrichment within annotated cell subpopulations to delineate the target distribution of BBR in PDAC. We identified 425 drug target genes and 771 disease target genes, using 57 intersecting genes to construct the PPI network. CytoHubba anchored the top 10 highest contributing genes to be the key cluster. mRNA expression levels and ROC curves confirmed that these genes showed good robustness for PDAC. CYBERSORT revealed that the key cluster influenced immune pathways predominantly associated with Macrophages M0, CD8 T cells, and na\u00efve B cells. ScRNA-seq analysis clarified that BBR mainly acted on epithelial cells and macrophages in PDAC tissues. BBR potentially targets CDK1, CCNB1, CTNNB1, CDK2, TOP2A, MCM2, RUNX2, MYC, PLK1, and AURKA to exert therapeutic effects on PDAC. The mechanisms of action appear to significantly involve macrophage polarization-related immunological responses."}

Herein, using the CRISPR method, the EGFR G719X mutant cell lines were constructed to assess the sensitivity of the rare mutation G719X in NSCLC. WZ3146, a novel mutation-selective EGFR inhibitor, was conducted transcriptome sequencing and in vitro experiments. The results showed that WZ3146 induced cytotoxic effects, inhibited growth vitality and proliferation via ERK and AKT pathway in the EGFR G719X mutant cells.

We performed transcriptomic analyses (including bulk and spatial transcriptomics) and multiplex immunofluorescence on pre-treated samples from LUADs without transformation after EGFR-TKI treatment (LUAD-NT), primary SCLCs (SCLC-P) and LUADs with transformation after EGFR-TKI treatment (before transformation: LUAD-BT; after transformation: SCLC-AT). Our study found that LUAD-BT exhibited potential transcriptomic characteristics for transformation compared with LUAD-NT. We identified several pathways that shifted during transformation, and the transformation might be promoted by epigenetic alterations (such as HDAC10, HDAC1, DNMT3A) within the tumor cells instead of within the tumor microenvironment. For druggable pathways, transformed-SCLC were proved to be less dependent on EGF signaling but more relied on FGF signaling, while VEGF-VEGFR pathway remained active, indicating potential treatments after transformation. We also found transformed-SCLC showed an immuno-exhausted status which was associated with the duration of EGFR-TKI before transformation. Besides, SCLC-AT exhibited distinct molecular subtypes from SCLC-P. Moreover, we constructed an ideal 4-marker model based on transcriptomic and IHC data to predict SCLC transformation, which obtained a sensitivity of 100% and 87.5%, a specificity of 95.7% and 100% in the training and test cohorts, respectively. We provided insights into the molecular mechanisms of SCLC transformation and the differences between SCLC-AT and SCLC-P, which might shed light on prevention strategies and subsequent therapeutic strategies for SCLC transformation in the future."}

Many studies have described the reconstitution after stem cell transplantation (SCT). The recovery after cancer treatment in children who have not undergone SCT has mainly been investigated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), less for solid tumors. Here, we have examined the temporal evolution of total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts as surrogate parameters for the post-therapeutic immune recovery in a cohort of n\u2009=\u200952 patients with ALL in comparison to n\u2009=\u200958 patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD) and n\u2009=\u200922 patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES). Patients with ALL showed an efficient increase in blood counts reaching the age-adjusted lower limits of normal between 4 and 5\u00a0months after the end of maintenance therapy. The two groups of patients with HD and ES exhibited a comparably delayed recovery of total leukocytes due to a protracted post-therapeutic lymphopenia which was most pronounced in patients with HD after irradiation. Overall, we observed a clearly more efficient resurgence of total lymphocyte counts in patients aged below 12\u00a0years compared to patients aged 12 to 18\u00a0years. Our results underline that the kinetics of cellular reconstitution after therapy for HD and ES differ significantly from ALL and depend on treatment regimens and modalities as well as on patient age. This suggests a need for disease, treatment, and age specific recommendations concerning the duration of infection prophylaxis and the timing of revaccination."}

This open-label randomized phase II OXEL study (NCT03487666) aimed to assess the immunologic effects of nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination in terms of the change in PIS (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included the presence of ctDNA, toxicity, clinical outcomes at 2-years and association of ctDNA and PIS with clinical outcomes. Forty-five women with TNBC and residual invasive disease after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination. Here we show that treatment with immunotherapy containing arms (nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus capecitabine) leads to an increase in PIS from baseline to week 6 compared with capecitabine alone, meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. In addition, the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is associated with disease recurrence, with no new safety signals in the combination arm. Our results provide efficacy and safety data on this combination in TNBC and support further development of PIS and ctDNA analyses to identify patients at high risk of recurrence."}

Traditionally, these tissues, sometimes called \u201cnormal adjacent tissue\u201d have been used as controls in cancer studies, and were considered representative of morphologically healthy, non-cancerous tissue. However, with the advancement of OMIC technologies, such tissues are increasingly recognized to be distinct from both tumor and healthy tissues. Furthermore, properties, characteristics, and role of these tissues in cancer formation and progression is increasingly studied. In order to make future research in this area more harmonized and more accessible, as well as to counter the widespread perception of normalcy, we are advocating the need for standardized naming convention. For this purpose, we propose the use of neutral and comprehensive term \u201cPeritumoral Tissue\u201d along with the acronym \u201cPTT\u201d. While significant amount of data on these tissues are publicly available, reuse of such data remains limited due to a lack of information on sample collection procedures. In order to facilitate future reuse of the data, we suggest a list of features that should be documented during sample collection procedures. These recommendations can aid the definition of Standard Operating Procedures."}

This trial met pre-specified endpoints. 27 female patients were enrolled sequentially to receive KN046 in two dose levels (3\u2009mg/kg or 5\u2009mg/kg). Among the 25 evaluable patients, the ORR achieved 44.0% (95% CI, 24.4% \u2212 65.1%), and the median DoR was not mature. The median PFS reached 7.33 months (95%CI, 3.68 \u2212 11.07 months), and the median OS was 30.92 months (95%CI, 14.75 - NE months). In PD-L1 positive patients, PFS was 8.61 months (versus 4.73 months) and the 2-year OS rate was 62.5% (versus 57.1%) compared to PD-L1 negative patients. Patients tolerated well the combination therapy. In general, KN046 combined with nab-paclitaxel showed favorable efficacy and survival benefits with tolerable toxicity in the first-line treatment of metastatic TNBC, especially PD-L1 positive, which is worth further investigation."}

To comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of inflamed CRC, we perform in vivo screening and identify 142 genes that are frequently mutated in inflammation-associated colon tumors. These genes include senescence and TGF\u03b2-activin signaling genes. We find that TNF\u03b1 can induce stemness and activate senescence signaling by enhancing cell plasticity in colonic epithelial cells, which could act as a selective pressure to mutate senescence-related genes in inflammation-associated colonic tumors. Furthermore, we show the efficacy of the Cdk4/6 inhibitor in vivo for inflammation-associated colonic tumors. Finally, we functionally validate that Arhgap5 and Mecom are tumor suppressor genes, providing possible therapeutic targets for CRC. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of the inactivation of senescence pathways in CRC development and progression in an inflammatory microenvironment, which can help progress toward precision medicine."}

However, the exact role of EBV in epithelial cancers remains elusive. Here, we report that EBV functions in vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Epithelial cancer cells infected with EBV develop tumor vascular networks that correlate with tumor growth, which is different from endothelial-derived angiogenic vessels and is VEGF-independent. Mechanistically, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling cascade, which is partly mediated by LMP2A, is responsible for EBV-induced VM formation. Both xenografts and clinical samples of NPC and EBVaGC exhibit VM histologically, which are correlated with AKT and HIF-1\u03b1 activation. Furthermore, although anti-VEGF monotherapy shows limited effects, potent synergistic antitumor activities are achieved by combination therapy with VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1-targeted agents. Our findings suggest that EBV creates plasticity in epithelial cells to express endothelial phenotype and provides a novel EBV-targeted antitumor strategy."}

A measurement protocol involving different geometries (reflectance and transmittance), subject\u2019s positions (sitting and lying down), probing locations (outer, lower, and inner breast quadrants), and source-detector distances (2 and 3\u00a0cm) allowed us to investigate the effect of tissue heterogeneity and different measurement configurations on the results with the aim of identifying the best experimental conditions for the estimate of breast density (i.e., amount of fibro-glandular tissue in the breast) as a strong independent risk factor for breast cancer. Transmittance results, that in previous studies correlated strongly with mammographic density, are used as a reference for the initial test of the simpler and more comfortable reflectance measurement configuration. The higher source-detector distance, which probes deeper tissue, retrieves optical outcomes in agreement with higher average density tissue. Similarly, results on the outer quadrants indicate higher density than internal quadrants. These findings are coherent with breast anatomy since the concentration of dense fibro-glandular stroma is higher in deep tissue and towards the external portion of the breast, where the mammary gland is located. The dataset generated with this laboratory campaign is used to device an optimal measurement protocol for a future clinical trial, where optical results will be correlated with conventional mammographic density, allowing us to identify a subset of wavelengths and measurement configurations for an effective estimate of breast density. The final objective is the design of a simplified, compact and cost-effective optical device for a non-invasive, routine assessment of density-associated breast cancer risk."}

In particular, a tumor-promoting effect can be assumed for the stroma and its fibroblasts. An influence of the immune system on non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is now also suspected. In our study, we examined 309 sections of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a subtype of NSCLC. We determined the cell densities and areas of the different tissues in SCC using the software QuPath. Spearman rank correlation showed a significant positive correlation between the different tumor cell densities and stromal cell densities, and between tumor cell densities and immune cell densities. Overall survival curves by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method revealed a prominent negative curve in cases of low immune cell density. Based on our results, we can assume a positive influence of the tumor microenvironment, especially the stromal cells, on tumor proliferation in SCC. We have also revealed that low density of immune cells is prognostically unfavorable."}

We construct a single-cell atlas comprising 410 million cells from 637 breast cancer WSIs and dissect the phenotypic diversity within tumor, inflammatory and stroma cells respectively. Spatially-resolved analysis identifies recurrent micro-ecological modules representing locoregional multicellular structures and reveals four breast cancer ecotypes correlating with distinct molecular features and patient prognosis. Further analysis with multiomics data uncovers clinically relevant ecosystem features. High abundance of locally-aggregated inflammatory cells indicates immune-activated tumor microenvironment and favorable immunotherapy response in triple-negative breast cancers. Morphological intratumor heterogeneity of tumor nuclei correlates with cell\u00a0cycle pathway activation and CDK inhibitors responsiveness in hormone receptor-positive cases. sc-MTOP enables using WSIs to characterize tumor ecosystems at the single-cell level."}

Given its T-cell infiltration, we hypothesized that MPM is a suitable target for therapeutic cancer vaccination. To date, research on mesothelioma has focused on the identification of molecular signatures to better classify and characterize the disease, and little is known about therapeutic targets that engage cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. In this study we investigate the immunopeptidomic antigen-presented landscape of MPM in both murine (AB12 cell line) and human cell lines (H28, MSTO-211H, H2452, and JL1), as well as in patients\u2019 primary tumors. Applying state-of-the-art immuno-affinity purification methodologies, we identify MHC I-restricted peptides presented on the surface of malignant cells. We characterize in vitro the immunogenicity profile of the eluted peptides using T cells from human healthy donors and cancer patients. Furthermore, we use the most promising peptides to formulate an oncolytic virus-based precision immunotherapy (PeptiCRAd) and test its efficacy in a mouse model of mesothelioma in female mice. Overall, we demonstrate that the use of immunopeptidomic analysis in combination with oncolytic immunotherapy represents a feasible and effective strategy to tackle untreatable tumors."}

Here, we use a \u201ctwo cell type\u201d whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening system to discover key regulators of tumor sensitivity and resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSC). We identify CHMP2A as a regulator of GSC resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and we confirm these findings in a head and neck squamous cells carcinoma (HNSCC) model. We show that deletion of CHMP2A activates NF-\u03baB in tumor cells to mediate increased chemokine secretion that promotes NK cell migration towards tumor cells. In the HNSCC model we demonstrate that CHMP2A mediates tumor resistance to NK cells via secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that express MICA/B and TRAIL. These secreted ligands induce apoptosis of NK cells to inhibit their antitumor activity. To confirm these in vitro studies, we demonstrate that deletion of CHMP2A in CAL27 HNSCC cells leads to increased NK cell-mediated killing in a xenograft immunodeficient mouse model. These findings illustrate a mechanism of tumor immune escape through EVs secretion and identify inhibition of CHMP2A and related targets as opportunities to improve NK cell-mediated immunotherapy."}

Here we show that elevated hyperpolarised [1-13C]lactate signal in prostate cancer compared to the benign prostate is primarily driven by increased tumour epithelial cell density and vascularity, rather than differences in epithelial lactate concentration between tumour and normal. We also demonstrate that some tumours of the cribriform subtype may lack [1-13C]lactate labelling, which is explained by lower epithelial lactate dehydrogenase expression, higher mitochondrial pyruvate carrier density, and increased lipid abundance compared to lactate-rich non-cribriform lesions. These findings highlight the potential of combining spatial metabolic imaging tools across scales to identify clinically significant metabolic phenotypes in prostate cancer."}

The primary objective of phase Ib was to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (100\u2009mg palbociclib, 5\u2009mg everolimus, 25\u2009mg exemestane).

Biswas", "Luminita Moraru"], "abstract": "Accurate and unbiased classification of breast lesions is pivotal for early diagnosis and treatment, and a deep learning approach can effectively represent and utilize the digital content of images for more precise medical image analysis. Breast ultrasound imaging is useful for detecting and distinguishing benign masses from malignant masses. Based on the different ways in which benign and malignant tumors affect neighboring tissues, i.e., the pattern of growth and border irregularities, the penetration degree of the adjacent tissue, and tissue-level changes, we investigated the relationship between breast cancer imaging features and the roles of inter- and extra-lesional tissues and their impact on refining the performance of deep learning classification. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in considering the features extracted from the tissue inside the tumor (by performing an erosion operation) and from the lesion and surrounding tissue (by performing a dilation operation) for classification. This study uses these new features and three pre-trained deep neuronal networks to address the challenge of breast lesion classification in ultrasound images. To improve the classification accuracy and interpretability of the model, the proposed model leverages transfer learning to accelerate the training process. Three modern pre-trained CNN architectures (MobileNetV2, VGG16, and EfficientNetB7) are used for transfer learning and fine-tuning for optimization. There are concerns related to the neuronal networks producing erroneous outputs in the presence of noisy images, variations in input data, or adversarial attacks; thus, the proposed system uses the BUS-BRA database (two classes/benign and malignant) for training and testing and the unseen BUSI database (two classes/benign and malignant) for testing. Extensive experiments have recorded accuracy and AUC as performance parameters. The results indicate that the proposed system outperforms the existing breast cancer detection algorithms reported in the literature. AUC values of 1.00 are calculated for VGG16 and EfficientNet-B7 in the dilation cases. The proposed approach will facilitate this challenging and time-consuming classification task."}

Although t-MN can occur both in adult and childhood cancer survivors, the mechanisms driving therapy-related leukemogenesis likely vary across different ages. Chemotherapy is thought to induce driver mutations in children, whereas in adults pre-existing mutant clones are selected by the exposure. However, selective pressures induced by chemotherapy early in life are less well studied. Here, we use single-cell whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic inference to show that the founding cell of t-MN in children starts expanding after cessation of platinum exposure. In patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by a germline TP53 mutation, we find that the t-MN already expands during treatment, suggesting that platinum-induced growth inhibition is TP53-dependent. Our results demonstrate that germline aberrations can interact with treatment exposures in inducing t-MN, which is important for the development of more targeted, patient-specific treatment regimens and follow-up."}

However, the impact of cross-presenting cDC1 and the potential of DC-based therapies in tumors carrying varied levels of bona-fide neoantigens (neoAgs) remain unclear. Here we develop a hypermutated model of non-small cell lung cancer in female mice, encoding genuine MHC-I neoepitopes to study neoAgs-specific CD8 T cell responses in spontaneous settings and upon Flt3L\u2009+\u2009\u03b1CD40 (DC-therapy). We find that cDC1 are required to generate broad CD8 responses against a range of diverse neoAgs. DC-therapy promotes immunogenicity of weaker neoAgs and strongly inhibits the growth of high tumor-mutational burden (TMB) tumors. In contrast, low TMB tumors respond poorly to DC-therapy, generating mild CD8 T cell responses that are not sufficient to block progression. scRNA transcriptional analysis, immune profiling and functional assays unveil the changes induced by DC-therapy in lung tissues, which comprise accumulation of cDC1 with increased immunostimulatory properties and less exhausted effector CD8 T cells. We conclude that boosting cDC1 activity is critical to broaden the diversity of anti-tumoral CD8 T cell responses and to leverage neoAgs content for therapeutic advantage."}

A total of 129 patients with anterior mediastinal tumors who received surgery in our hospital between January 2018 and July 2022 were consecutively enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on mediastinal tumor diameter: Group A (tumor size between 1.0 and 4.9\u00a0cm) and Group B (tumor size between 5.0 and 10.0\u00a0cm). The primary endpoints were operation time, blood loss, and postoperative pain, and the secondary endpoints were the volume of drainage, drainage duration, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Significant differences were found in the volume of drainage between the two groups (Group A: 218.4\u2009\u00b1\u2009140.6, Group B: 398.9\u2009\u00b1\u2009369.3, P\u2009<\u20090.001).

Overall, 90% (n\u2009=\u2009245) of enrolled patients who underwent the first leukapheresis collected\u2009\u2265\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 PBSC/kg, 2.6% (n\u2009=\u20097) mobilized\u2009<\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 PBSC/kg and 7.7% (n\u2009=\u200921) failed the collection. Similar results were obtained for the planned second leukapheresis, with only one patient failing both attempts. Median count of reinfused PBSC was 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/kg and median time to recovery from neutropenia G4 was 10\u00a0days from ASCT. No impact of mobilizing subtype or number of reinfused PBSC on hematological recovery and LEN dose reduction was noted. At a median follow-up of 75\u00a0months from ASCT, PFS and OS of transplanted patients were 50% and 73%, respectively. A long lasting G4 neutropenia after ASCT (>\u200910\u00a0days) was associated with a worse outcome, both in terms of PFS and OS. In conclusion, although the harvesting procedures proved feasible for younger MCL patients, long-lasting cytopenia following ASCT remains a significant issue: this can hinder the administration of effective maintenance therapies, potentially increasing the relapse rate and negatively affecting survival outcomes."}
{"title": "HMGB2-induced calreticulin translocation required for immunogenic cell death and ferroptosis of cancer cells are controlled by the nuclear exporter XPO1", "published": "01 October 2024", "authors": ["Jingqi Fan", "Kevin P. Gillespie", "Clementina Mesaros", "Ian A. Blair"], "abstract": "Cisplatin and oxaliplatin cause the secretion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein from cancer cells, which is necessary for initiation of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Calreticulin (CRT) translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane is also required; oxaliplatin induces this translocation but cisplatin does not. We have discovered that oxaliplatin causes the secretion of both HMGB1 and HMGB2 from the cell nucleus into the extracellular milieu. We previously showed that cisplatin-mediated secretion of HMGB1 is controlled by the nuclear exporter XPO1 (chromosomal maintenance 1; CRM1). We now find that XPO1 regulates oxaliplatin-mediated secretion of both HMGB1 and HMGB2. XPO1 inhibition causes nuclear accumulation of both proteins, inhibition of oxaliplatin-mediated ferroptosis of colon cancer cells, and inhibition of CRT translocation to the plasma membrane of lung and colon cancer cells. Incubation of cancer cells with cell targeted (CT)-HMGB2 confirmed that HMGB2 is required for the CRT translocation. Furthermore, CT-HMGB2 is three orders of magnitude more potent at inducing CRT translocation than oxaliplatin."}

Healey"], "abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a multimodal neural network (MMNN) model that analyzes clinical variables and MRI images of a soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patient, to predict overall survival and risk of distant metastases. We compare the performance of this MMNN to models based on clinical variables alone, radiomics models, and an unimodal neural network. We include patients aged 18 or older with biopsy-proven STS who underwent primary resection between January 1st, 2005, and December 31st, 2020 with complete outcome data and a pre-treatment MRI with both a T1 post-contrast sequence and a T2 fat-sat sequence available. A total of 9380 MRI slices containing sarcomas from 287 patients are available. Our MMNN accepts the entire 3D sarcoma volume from T1 and T2 MRIs and clinical variables. Gradient blending allows the clinical and image sub-networks to optimally converge without overfitting. Heat maps were generated to visualize the salient image features. Our MMNN outperformed all other models in predicting overall survival and the risk of distant metastases. The C-Index of our MMNN for overall survival is 0.77 and the C-Index for risk of distant metastases is 0.70. The provided heat maps demonstrate areas of sarcomas deemed most salient for predictions. Our multimodal neural network with gradient blending improves predictions of overall survival and risk of distant metastases in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Future work enabling accurate subtype-specific predictions will likely utilize similar end-to-end multimodal neural network architecture and require prospective curation of high-quality data, the inclusion of genomic data, and the involvement of multiple centers through federated learning."}

In a multi-site population-based patient cohort study of 2116 CRC patients with baseline blood-DNAm, we analyzed survival predictions using eXtreme Gradient Boosting with a 5-fold nested leave-sites-out cross-validation across four groups: traditional and comprehensive clinical features, blood-DNAm, and their combination. Model performance was assessed using time-dependent ROC curves and calibrations. During a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 1166 patients died. Although blood-DNAm-based predictive signatures achieved moderate performances, predictive signatures based on clinical features outperformed blood-DNAm signatures. The inclusion of blood-DNAm did not improve survival prediction over clinical features. M1 stage, age at blood collection, and N2 stage were the top contributors. Despite some prognostic value, incorporating blood DNA methylation did not enhance survival prediction of CRC patients beyond clinical features."}

The most frequent secondary alteration, demonstrated in \u223c70% of GISTs, is chromosome 14q deletion. Here we report hemizygous or homozygous inactivating mutations of the chromosome 14q MAX gene in 16 of 76 GISTs (21%). We find MAX mutations in 17% and 50% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and we find loss of MAX protein expression in 48% and 90% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and in three of eight micro-GISTs, which are early GISTs. MAX genomic inactivation is associated with p16 silencing in the absence of p16 coding sequence deletion and MAX induction restores p16 expression and inhibits GIST proliferation. Hence, MAX inactivation is a common event in GIST progression, fostering cell cycle activity in early GISTs."}
{"title": "Complete morphologic response to gilteritinib in ALK-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia", "published": "10 September 2024", "authors": ["Jacob J. Adashek", "Max Brodsky", "Mark J. Levis"], "abstract": "The cytogenetic abnormality inv(2)(p23q13) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in a fusion of RANBP2 with ALK. This fusion makes ALK constitutively active and acts as a driver for the proliferation of AML cell lines. Gilteritinib, a FLT3 inhibitor approved in AML, also can inhibit ALK among other receptor tyrosine kinases. A 75-year-old-woman with a history of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and a presumed germline DDX41 mutation developed ALK-fusion positive AML and despite standard therapies was transfusion-dependent and globally declining. The patient has been on gilteritinib with an ongoing response of more than one year with near normal blood counts and no evidence of AML. The fact that she was found to harbor a presumed germline DDX41 alteration may account for why she developed, and yet survived, two myeloid neoplasms (ET and AML). Additionally, this demonstrates that gilteritinib is clinically active as an ALK inhibitor, and could be considered for use in any AML patient presenting with an inv(2(p23q13)) translocation. Finally, it is an example of using a disease-agnostic, precision medicine approach to arrive at a beneficial treatment."}

Here we report the case of a patient diagnosed with clearly demarcated, pathologically heterogenous triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ breast cancer that was treated with a hybrid chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining elements of Keynote-522 and a standard HER2-directed neoadjuvant regimen, yielding apathologic complete response by the time of surgery with no notable adverse events. Molecular analysis of the histologically distinct tumor populations confirmed molecular evidence of differential HER2 expression but also suggested clonal relatedness of the two tumor populations based upon mutational profile, with phenotypic divergence potentially resulting from copy number alterations in NF1. Overall, this case highlights a rare histologic phenomenon that was successfully treated by combining both TNBC and HER2 directed neoadjuvant therapies."}

BAT/nivolumab was well tolerated, resulting in only five (11%) drug related, grade-3 adverse events. In a predefined exploratory analysis, clinical response rates correlated with increased baseline levels of intratumoral PD-1\u2009+\u2009T cells. In paired metastatic tumor biopsies, BAT induced pro-inflammatory gene expression changes\u00a0that were restricted to patients achieving a clinical response. These data suggest that BAT may augment antitumor immune responses that are further potentiated by immune checkpoint blockade."}

Several interventional approaches to treat these deficits have been studied, including web-based cognitive training, but methods and timing in relation to cancer treatment are heterogeneous. Only few interventions start early after primary breast cancer treatment, a time when many patients report the greatest impairments in quality of life and cognition. In this randomized controlled pilot study, 31 breast cancer survivors with subjective cognitive deficits and a mean post-treatment duration of 6.6 months (SD\u2009=\u20099.3) were assigned to either 14 weeks of a web-based cognitive training program (training group, n\u2009=\u200916) or a control group (n\u2009=\u200915). All patients underwent detailed neuropsychological assessment, evaluation of patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), and neurological examination before (baseline, T1) and after (follow-up, T2) the intervention. Longitudinal (T1 vs. T2) and cross-sectional (T2) cognitive performance was assessed for both groups. Overall cognitive impairment significantly improved in the training group following training (56% vs 25%; p\u2009=\u20090.03, Phi\u2009=\u20090.51), but not in the control group (73% vs. 73%; p\u2009=\u20091) in the longitudinal analysis (T1 vs. T2). Specifically, the training group showed statistically significant improvement of executive functions (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Phi\u2009=\u20090.32). No effects of training on subjective cognitive deficits or PROMs were observed. Comparing cross-sectional cognitive performance at follow-up (T2), the training group showed a significantly lower rate of cognitive impairment overall (p\u2009=\u20090.007, Phi\u2009=\u20090.48) and a better cognitive performance for executive function (p\u2009=\u20090.04, Phi\u2009=\u20090.32) compared to the control group. In this prospective pilot study, web-based cognitive training was efficacious in improving overall cognitive performance and executive function. Importantly, this study investigated a web-based cognitive training for the immediate post-treatment phase, when up to 75% of breast cancer patients experience cognitive decline. These results indicate that cognitive training may improve neuropsychological outcomes for patients with breast cancer."}

Despite the large number of studies revealing the complex pathogenic network of DGC, the molecular heterogeneity of DGC is still not fully understood. We obtained single-cell RNA-seq data and bulk data from the tumor immune single cell hub, the public gene expression omnibus, and the cancer genome atlas databases. A series of bioinformatics analyses were performed using R software. Immunofluorescence staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, western blot, and functional experiments were used for experimental validation. Caudin-3, -4 and -7 were lowly expressed in DGC and their expression levels were further reduced in PCC. The PCC components were mainly located in the deeper layers of the DGC and had a high level of hypoxic Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and stemness. We further identified Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 7 (IGFBP7) as a marker for PCC components in the deep layer. IGFBP7 is stimulated by hypoxia and promotes cancer cell invasiveness and reduced claudin expression. In addition, programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) was specifically expressed in the deep layer, reflecting deep layer-specific immunosuppression. The PCC components are predominantly situated in the deeper layers of DGC. Initial molecular characterization of these PCC components revealed distinct features, including low expression of claudin-3, -4, and -7, high expression of IGFBP7, and the presence of PD-L1. These molecular traits may partially account for the pronounced tumor heterogeneity observed in GC."}

The prognosis of patients with different surgical extents remains controversial. Therefore, the effects of different surgical extents on the prognosis of patients were explored in this retrospective cohort study. Patients with malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors who underwent surgical treatment from January 2000 to December 2019 were selected. Disease-free\u00a0survival and overall survival rates were\u00a0calculated\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Kaplan\u2013Meier method and\u00a0compared by the\u00a0log-rank test.

MM patients with aggressive progression have poor survival, emphasizing the urgent need for identifying new therapeutic targets. Here, we show that the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1), a transmembrane receptor conducting negative immune response, is a top-ranked gene associated with poor prognosis in MM patients. LILRB1 deficiency inhibits MM progression in vivo by enhancing the ferroptosis of MM cells. Mechanistic studies reveal that LILRB1 forms a complex with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR adapter protein 1 (LDLRAP1) to facilitate LDL/cholesterol uptake. Loss of LILRB1 impairs cholesterol uptake but activates the de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis, leading to the decrease of anti-ferroptotic metabolite squalene. Our study uncovers the function of LILRB1 in regulating cholesterol metabolism and protecting MM cells from ferroptosis, implicating LILRB1 as a promising therapeutic target for MM patients."}

The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic target, but the effectiveness of PD-1 antibody sintilimab in combination with immunochemotherapy as a frontline treatment for PCNSL remains to be determined. In this phase 2 trial (ChiCTR1900027433) with a safety run-in, we included patients aged 18\u201370 with newly diagnosed PCNSL. Participants underwent six 21-day cycles of a SMTR regimen, which includes sintilimab (200\u2009mg, Day 0), rituximab (375\u2009mg/m2, Day 0), methotrexate (3.0\u2009g/m2, Day 1 or 1.0\u2009g/m2 for patients aged \u226565 years), and temozolomide (150\u2009mg/m2/d, Days 1\u20135). Among 27 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 96.3% (95% confidence interval: 81\u201399.9%), with 25 complete responses. At a median follow-up of 24.4 months, the medians for duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival were not reached. The most common grade 3\u20134 treatment-related toxicities were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (17.9%) and aspartate aminotransferase (14.3%). Additionally, baseline levels of interferon-\u03b1 and the IL10/IL6 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid emerged as potential predictors of PFS, achieving areas under the curve of 0.88 and 0.84, respectively, at 2 years. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a higher prevalence of RTK-RAS and PI3K pathway mutations in the durable clinical benefit group, while a greater frequency of Notch and Hippo pathway mutations in the no durable benefit group. These findings suggest the SMTR regimen is highly efficacious and tolerable for newly diagnosed PCNSL, warranting further investigation."}

Madhu Krishna", "Pankaj Garg", "Sravani Ramisetty", "Ayalur Raghu Subbalakshmi", "Prakash Kulkarni", "Ravi Salgia", "Sharad S. Singhal"], "abstract": "Cancer ranks as the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, prompting extensive investigations into factors contributing to its development. Among these factors, genetic variations, known as genotypic polymorphisms, have been identified as significant influencers in the susceptibility to various types of cancer. Recent research has focused on exploring the connection between polymorphisms in the Long Non-coding RNA HOTAIR and cancer risk. However, the results from these studies have been inconsistent, leading to ambiguity and controversy. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a systematic analysis by gathering relevant studies from PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Specifically, we focused on three well-studied polymorphisms within the HOTAIR lncRNA (HOTAIR rs920778 C\u2009>\u2009T, HOTAIR rs1899663 G\u2009>\u2009T, HOTAIR rs4759314 A\u2009>\u2009G) and their association with cancer risk. Our meta-analysis included data from 48 case\u2013control studies involving 42,321 cases and 54,137 controls. The results of our updated meta-analysis revealed a significant correlation between HOTAIR rs1899663 G\u2009>\u2009T and HOTAIR rs4759314 A\u2009>\u2009G polymorphisms and overall cancer risk, particularly in the homozygous and recessive genetic models. Subgroup analysis further revealed that these associations were notably pronounced in the Asian population but not observed in the Iranian population. Furthermore, our findings underscore the potential of HOTAIR polymorphisms as diagnostic markers for overall cancer risk, particularly in gynecological cancers, precisely, HOTAIR rs1899663 G\u2009>\u2009T polymorphism in breast cancer. In conclusion, our systematic analysis provides compelling evidence that Long Non-coding RNA HOTAIR polymorphisms are linked to cancer risk, particularly in certain populations and cancer types, suggesting their potential clinical relevance as diagnostic indicators."}

Here we present a solution leveraging the flexibility of bacterial virus (phage) nanofibers with their sidewalls displaying target circulating tumor cell-specific aptamers and their ends tethered to magnetic beads. Such flexible phages, with low stiffness and Young\u2019s modulus, can twist and adapt to recognize the cell receptors, energetically enhancing target cell capturing and entropically discouraging non-target cells (white blood cells) adsorption. The magnetic beads with flexible phages can isolate and count target cells with significant increase in cell affinity and reduction in non-target cell absorption compared to magnetic beads having rigid phages. This differentiates breast cancer patients and healthy donors, with impressive area under the curve (0.991) at the optimal detection threshold (>4 target cells mL\u22121). Immunostaining of captured circulating tumor cells precisely determines breast cancer subtypes with a diagnostic accuracy of 91.07%. Our study reveals the power of viral mechanical attributes in designing surfaces with superior target binding and non-target anti-fouling."}

Cholesterol oxidation can lead to lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, and cell death. Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which significantly inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells. SQLE is the primary enzyme responsible for catalyzing cholesterol lipid synthesis and is notably expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cells. This study aims to investigate the role of squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) in ferroptosis in ovarian cancer. The protein and mRNA expression of SQLE was assessed using qRT-PCR, Western Blot, and immunohistochemistry. The association between SQLE and ferroptosis was demonstrated through analysis of TCGA and GTEx databases, TMT protein sequencing, as well as validation by qRT-PCR, Western Blot, immunofluorescence, ROS detection, and lipid peroxide detection. Animal experiments further confirmed the relationship between SQLE and ferroptosis in ovarian cancer. The protein and mRNA expression of SQLE was found to be upregulated in both ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Decreased SQLE expression led to ferroptosis in ovarian cancer cells, thereby increasing their sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers. Our research demonstrates that SQLE is significantly upregulated in both ovarian cancer tissues and cells. The overexpression of SQLE in ovarian cancer may facilitate tumorigenesis by conferring resistance to ferroptosis, thus shedding light on potential novel therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer."}

Studying CCA CSC has been challenging, due to lack of consensus CSC markers, and to their plastic nature. Since dual expression of the core pluripotent factors SOX2/OCT4 has been shown to correlate with poor outcome in CCA patients, we selected the SOX2/OCT4 activating short half-life GFP-based live reporter (SORE6-dsCopGFP) to study CSC dynamics at the single-cell level. Transduction of five human CCA cell lines resulted in the expression of 1.8\u201313.1% GFP-positive (SORE6POS) cells. By live imaging, we found that SORE6POS CCA cells possess self-renewal capacity and that they can be induced to differentiate. Significantly, the SORE6POS cells were highly tumorigenic, both in vitro and in vivo, thus implicating the characteristics of primary CSCs. When we then analyzed for selected CSC-related markers, we found that the majority of both CD133+/CD44+, and CD133+/LGR5+ CCA cells were SORE6POS cells. Exposing transduced cells to standard CCA chemotherapy revealed higher growth rate inhibition at 50% (GR50s) for SORE6POS cells compared to GFP-negative (SORE6NEG) ones indicating that these CSC-like cells were more resistant to the treatment. Moreover, the chemotherapy induced SORE6POS from SORE6NEG cells, while retaining the existing SORE6POS population. Finally, treatment of transduced cells with CDK4/6 inhibitors in vitro for 3 days resulted in a lowered CSC number in the culture. Thus, applying a live reporter system allowed us to elucidate the stem cell diversity and drug-induced plasticity of CCA CSCs. These findings have clear implications for future management of such patients."}

Using this framework, currently composed of thousands of individuals with cancer and millions of data points over a decade of data recording, we demonstrate prognostic utility of this framework in oncology. As proof of concept, we report an analysis using this infrastructure, which identified the Framingham risk score to be robustly associated with mortality among individuals with early-stage and advanced-stage cancer, a potentially actionable finding from a real-world cohort of individuals with cancer. Finally, we show how natural language processing (NLP) of medical notes could be used to continuously update estimates of prognosis as a given individual\u2019s disease course unfolds."}

However, developing combination therapies is difficult due to dose-limiting toxicities, blood-brain-barrier, and suppressive tumor microenvironment. Glioblastoma is notoriously devoid of lymphocytes driven in part by a paucity of lymphocyte trafficking factors necessary to prompt their recruitment and activation. Herein, we develop a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy that enables focal and stable reconstitution of the tumor microenvironment with C-X-C motif ligand 9 (CXCL9), a powerful call-and-receive chemokine for lymphocytes. By manipulating local chemokine directional guidance, AAV-CXCL9 increases tumor infiltration by cytotoxic lymphocytes, sensitizing glioblastoma to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade in female preclinical tumor models. These effects are accompanied by immunologic signatures evocative of an inflamed tumor microenvironment. These findings support AAV gene therapy as an adjuvant for reconditioning glioblastoma immunogenicity given its safety profile, tropism, modularity, and off-the-shelf capability."}

The purpose of this study is to clarify the associations between them and LC, as well as the differences in these associations between patients of different ethnicities (Caucasians and Asians), LC subtypes and smoking status. Relevant literatures published before July 7, 2023 in PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, MEDLINE were searched through the Internet. Statistical analysis of data was performed in Revman 5.3, including drawing forest plots, funnel plots and so on. Sensitivity and publication bias were performed in Stata 14.0. TSA software was performed for the trial sequential analysis (TSA) tests to assess the stability of the results. Registration number: CRD42023407890. A total of 41 literatures (containing 44 studies: 16 studies in Caucasians and 28 studies in Asians) were included in this meta-analysis, including 126476 LC patients and 191648 healthy controls.

The rs402710[T] was negatively associated with the risk of NSCLC, LUAD and LUSC (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and these negative associations in Caucasians were the same as in Asians (Subgroup differences: I2\u2009<\u200950%). The rs401681[T] was negatively associated with the risk of LC in both smokers and non-smokers (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and the negative association for smokers equals to that of non-smokers (Subgroup differences: P\u2009=\u20090.25, I2\u2009=\u200924.2%). In LC subtypes, the rs401681[T] was negatively associated with the risks of NSCLC and LUAD in both Caucasian smokers and Asian non-smokers (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The rs402710[T] was negatively associated with the risk of LC in both smokers and non-smokers (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and there was no difference in the strength of this negative risk association between them in Caucasians (Subgroup differences: I2\u2009=\u20090%). In Asians, this negative association was found to be predominantly among smokers ([OR]\u2009=\u20090.80, 95%CI [0.65, 0.99]). In LC subtypes, the rs402710[T]was negatively associated with the risk of NSCLC in non-smokers, and this negative association was found to be predominantly among non-smokers in Asians ([OR]\u2009=\u20090.75, 95%CI [0.60, 0.94]). The T allele variants of rs401681 and rs402710 are both negatively associated with the risk of developing LC, NSCLC (LUAD, LUSC) in the Caucasian and Asian populations, and the negative associations with the risk of LC are higher in Caucasians. Smoking is an important risk factor for inducing the rs401681 and rs402710 variants and causes LC development in both populations. Other factors like non-smoking are mainly responsible for inducing the development of NSCLC in Asians, and is concentrated in LUAD among Asian non-smoking women."}

Data from the SEER Program spanning 2000\u20132020 were analyzed, focusing on breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, pancreatic cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Age-standardized relative survival rates were calculated to assess racial (White, Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander) and ethnic (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic) disparities, utilizing period analysis for recent estimates and excluding cases identified solely through autopsy or death certificates. While significant survival improvements were observed for most cancers, notable disparities persisted. Non-Hispanic Blacks exhibited the largest gain in breast cancer survival, with an increase of 5.2% points (from 77.6 to 82.8%); however, the survival rate remained lower than that of Non-Hispanic Whites (92.1%). Colorectal cancer survival declined overall (64.7\u201364.1%), marked by a 6.2% point drop for Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (66.3\u201360.1%). Prostate cancer survival declined across all races, with Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives showing a decrease of 7.7% points (from 96.9 to 89.2%). Lung cancer, acute leukemia, and multiple myeloma showed notable increases across groups. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival underscore the notable need for tailored strategies ensuring equitable access to advanced treatments, particularly addressing significant trends in colorectal and pancreatic cancers among specific minority groups.

Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo, we target five potential tumor suppressor genes (Pten, Trp53, Rb1, Stk11, and RnaseL) in the mouse prostate, reaching humane endpoint after eight weeks without metastasis. By further depleting three epigenetic factors (Kmt2c, Kmt2d, and Zbtb16), lung metastases are present in all mice. While whole genome sequencing reveals few mutations in coding sequence, RNA sequencing shows significant dysregulation, especially in a conserved genomic region at chr5qE1 regulated by KMT2C. Depleting Odam and Cabs1 in this region prevents metastasis. Notably, the gene expression signatures, resulting from our study, predict progression-free and overall survival and distinguish primary and metastatic human prostate cancer.

One major NADPH production route is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (committed step: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD). Alternatives exist and can compensate in some tumors. Here, using genetically-engineered lung cancer mouse\u00a0models, we show that G6PD ablation significantly suppresses KrasG12D/+;Lkb1-/- (KL) but not KrasG12D/+;P53-/- (KP) lung tumorigenesis. In vivo isotope tracing and metabolomics reveal that G6PD ablation significantly impairs NADPH generation, redox balance, and de novo lipogenesis in KL but not KP lung tumors. Mechanistically, in KL tumors, G6PD ablation activates p53, suppressing tumor growth. As tumors progress, G6PD-deficient KL tumors increase an alternative NADPH source from serine-driven one carbon metabolism, rendering associated tumor-derived cell lines sensitive to serine/glycine depletion. Thus, oncogenic driver mutations determine lung cancer dependence on G6PD, whose targeting is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors harboring KRAS and LKB1 co-mutations."}

Here, using primary care electronic health records from Catalonia, Spain (SIDIAP), we built two large cohorts of vaccinated and matched control cancer patients with a primary vaccination scheme (n\u2009=\u2009184,744) and a booster (n\u2009=\u2009108,534). Most patients received a mRNA-based product in primary (76.2%) and booster vaccination (99.9%). Patients had 51.8% (95% CI 40.3%\u221261.1%) and 58.4% (95% CI 29.3%\u221275.5%) protection against COVID-19 hospitalization and COVID-19 death respectively after full vaccination (two-doses) and 77.9% (95% CI 69.2%\u221284.2%) and 80.2% (95% CI 63.0%\u221289.4%) after booster. Compared to primary vaccination, the booster dose provided higher peak protection during follow-up. Calibration of VE estimates with negative outcomes, and sensitivity analyses with slight different population and COVID-19 outcomes definitions provided similar results. Our results confirm the role of primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 severe events in patients with cancer and highlight the need for the additional dose in this population."}

This multicenter, single-arm phase II trial (NCT03876587) aimed to assess the benefit of pyrotinib plus docetaxel as a first-line treatment for HER2-positive MBC. Women with HER2-positive MBC who had not undergone HER2 blockade or chemotherapy for metastatic disease were enrolled in the study and received daily oral pyrotinib 400\u2009mg plus intravenous docetaxel 75\u2009mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival (OS) and safety. From June 2019 to June 2021, 79 patients were enrolled. The confirmed ORR was 79.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.8-88.6), and the CBR was 87.3% (95%CI, 80.0-94.6) in the intention-to-treat population. The pre-specified primary endpoint was met. The median DoR was 15.9 months (interquartile range, 8.3-19.5); the median PFS was 16.0 months (95% CI, 11.2-20.8), and the median OS was not reached. The most common grade \u22653 treatment-related adverse events observed were leukopenia (29.1%), neutropenia (27.8%), and diarrhea (21.5%). This study demonstrates that pyrotinib plus docetaxel show an acceptable safety profile and promising antitumor activity as a first-line treatment option for patients with HER2-positive MBC."}

Here, we identify PJA1 as a key E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma chemoresistance that is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with nonresponse to docetaxel-cisplatin-5-fluorouracil induction chemotherapy. We find that PJA1 facilitates docetaxel resistance by inhibiting GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, PJA1 promotes the degradation of the mitochondrial protein PGAM5 by increasing its K48-linked ubiquitination at K88, which further facilitates DRP1 phosphorylation at S637 and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, resulting in suppression of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis and the antitumour immune response. PGAM5 knockdown fully restores the docetaxel sensitization effect of PJA1 knockdown. Moreover, pharmacological targeting of PJA1 with the small molecule inhibitor RTA402 enhances the docetaxel sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, high PJA1 expression indicates inferior survival and poor clinical efficacy of TPF IC in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Our study emphasizes the essential role of E3 ligases in regulating chemoresistance and provides therapeutic strategies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system."}

Treatment by the OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-010759 strongly inhibits tumour growth in multiple endocrine and palbociclib resistant PDX. Mutations in the PIK3CA/AKT1 genes are significantly associated with response to IACS-010759. At the metabolic level, in vivo response to IACS-010759 is associated with decreased levels of metabolites of the glutathione, glycogen and pentose phosphate pathways in treated tumours. In vitro, endocrine and palbociclib resistant cells show increased OXPHOS dependency and increased ROS levels upon IACS-010759 treatment. Finally, in ER\u2009+\u2009BC patients, high expression of OXPHOS associated genes predict poor prognosis.

The role of myeloid cells and their progenitors prior to tumor infiltration is poorly understood. Here we show single-cell transcriptomics and functional analyses of the myeloid cell lineage in patients with non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (TC) and multinodular goiter, before and after treatment with radioactive iodine compared to healthy controls. Integrative data analysis indicates that monocytes of TC patients have transcriptional upregulation of antigen presentation, reduced cytokine production capacity, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, these cancer-related pathological changes are partially removed upon treatment. In bone marrow, TC patients tend to shift from myelopoiesis towards lymphopoiesis, reflected in transcriptional differences. Taken together, distinct transcriptional and functional changes in myeloid cells arise before their infiltration of the tumor and are already initiated in bone marrow, which suggests an active role in forming the tumor immune microenvironment."}

However, it is difficult to predict which eyes are likely to respond to therapy. Predictive molecular biomarkers are needed to guide prognosis and optimize treatment decisions. Direct tumor biopsy is not an option for this cancer; however, the aqueous humor (AH) is an alternate source of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Here we show that DNA methylation profiling of the AH is a valid method to identify the methylation status of RB tumors. We identify 294 genes directly regulated by methylation that are implicated in p53 tumor suppressor (RB1, p53, p21, and p16) and oncogenic (E2F) pathways. Finally, we use AH to characterize molecular subtypes that can potentially be used to predict the likelihood of treatment success for retinoblastoma patients."}

Preoperative AFP was negative, while CA19-9 was elevated in two cases. Surgical resection was performed for all patients. The patients showed favorable postoperative recovery. Follow-up revealed an excellent overall survival rate, except for one case of invasive carcinoma resulting in tumor recurrence and metastasis 6 months after surgery. MCN poses a diagnostic challenge due to the absence of distinct clinical and radiological features, leading to potential misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Patients with suspected liver cystic diseases should consider the possibility of MCN. Surgical resection has proven to be a practical approach with satisfactory therapeutic outcomes."}

In this retrospective study, 122 patients (including 108 patients with dense breasts) with ambiguous FFDM findings were imaged with both CSC and TSC. Two radiologists independently reviewed the images and evaluated lesions using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. Pathology or at least a 1-year follow-up imaging was used as the reference standard. Diagnostic efficacies of CSC and TSC were compared, including area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The mean glandular dose was recorded and compared for TSC and CSC. Of the 122 patients, 63 had benign lesions and 59 had malignant lesions. For Reader 1, the following diagnostic efficacies of TSC were significantly higher than those of CSC: AUC (0.988 vs. 0.906, P\u2009=\u20090.001), accuracy (93.4% vs. 77.8%, P\u2009=\u20090.001), specificity (87.3% vs. 63.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.002), PPV (88.1% vs. 70.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.010), and NPV (100% vs. 90.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.029).

Accurate and non-invasive prediction of MSI status is crucial for cost savings and guiding clinical treatment strategies. The retrospective study enrolled 307 CRC patients between January 2020 and October 2022. Preoperative images of computed tomography and postoperative status of MSI information were available for analysis. The stratified fivefold cross-validation was used to avoid sample bias in grouping. Feature extraction and model construction were performed as follows: first, inter-/intra-correlation coefficients and the least absolute shrinkage\u00a0and\u00a0selection operator algorithm were used to identify the most predictive feature subset. Subsequently, multiple discriminant models were constructed to explore and optimize the combination of six feature preprocessors (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, Max-Abs, Min\u2013Max, Z-score, and Quantile) and three classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Selecting the one with the highest average value of the area under the curve (AUC) in the test set as the radiomics model, and the clinical screening model and combined model were also established using the same processing steps as the radiomics model. Finally, the performances of the three models were evaluated and analyzed using decision and correction curves.We observed that the logistic regression model based on the quantile preprocessor had the highest average AUC value in the discriminant models. Additionally, tumor location, the clinical of N stage, and hypertension were identified as independent clinical predictors of MSI status. In the test set, the clinical screening model demonstrated good predictive performance, with the average AUC of 0.762 (95% confidence interval, 0.635\u20130.890). Furthermore, the combined model showed excellent predictive\u00a0performance (AUC, 0.958; accuracy, 0.899; sensitivity, 0.929) and favorable clinical applicability and correction effects.

Nonetheless, the actual impacts of PANoptosis on clinical management and oncology immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not fully grasped. RNA-seq-derived computations were conducted to sort out the molecular subtypes and elucidate the disparities based on PANoptosis molecules. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) tools including Cytotrace and Addmodulescore were extracted to characterize diversification potency and quantify the PANoptosis motion. Transcriptional factors were inferred by the pySCENIC package and Cellchat program scrutinized the intercellular exchange across cell compartments. The PANoptosis score system originated by incorporating 10 machine learning algorithms and 101 compositions to project clinical results and deteriorate tendencies. Circulatory PANoptosis-associated protein HSP90AA1 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HCC individuals could be categorized into low- and high-PANoptosis groups with diverse biogenic and pharmacotherapy heterogeneity. Individuals in the elevated PANoptosis subtype were characterized as \u201chot tumor\u201d conveying the increased presence of immunogenicity while reiterating an explicit negative connection with tumor stemness. Compared to immune and stromal cells, cancerous cells showcased decreased PANoptosis and heightened PANoptosis malignant cell subgroups might be tied to a substantial level of genomic expression of SREBF2, JUND, GATAD1, ZBTB20, SMAD5 and implied a more aggressive potential. The PANoptosis index, derived from machine learning, has been established to provide succinct frameworks for predicting outcomes and clarified the noteworthy utility of conventional regimens, as the differentiated power of HCC occurred together with vascular invasion and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). The experiment confirmed that the circulating HSP90AA1 was aberrantly augmented in HCC patients, thus demonstrating its potential as a discriminatory biomarker. We systematically deciphered the molecular and immune ecosystem traits of PANoptosis in bulk and scRNA-seq degrees, which may deliver advantageous insights for customized treatment, awareness of the pathological process and prognosis scrutiny for HCC patients."}

Using a combination of physiologic, pharmacologic and genetic strategies, we observe improvements in the control of both irradiated and non-irradiated distant tumors, including metastatic tumors, when adrenergic stress or signaling through \u03b2-adrenergic receptor is reduced. Further, we observe cellular and molecular evidence of improved, antigen-specific, anti-tumor immune responses which also depend upon T cell egress from draining lymph nodes. These data suggest that blockade of \u03b22 adrenergic stress signaling could be a useful, safe, and feasible strategy to improve efficacy in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy."}

Women with advanced TNBC exhibit aggressive disease and have limited treatment options. Although immune suppressive TME is implicated in driving aggressive properties of basal/TNBC subtype and therapy resistance, effectively targeting it remains a challenge. Minnelide, a prodrug of triptolide currently being tested in clinical trials, has shown anti-tumorigenic activity in multiple malignancies via targeting super enhancers, Myc and anti-apoptotic pathways such as HSP70. Distinct super-enhancer landscape drives cancer stem cells (CSC) in TNBC subtype while inducing immune suppressive TME. We show that Minnelide selectively targets CSCs in human and murine TNBC cell lines compared to cell lines of luminal subtype by targeting Myc and HSP70. Minnelide in combination with cyclophosphamide significantly reduces the tumor growth and eliminates metastasis by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and enhancing cytotoxic T cell infiltration in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Resection of residual tumors following the combination treatment leads to complete eradication of disseminated tumor cells as all mice are free of local and distant recurrences. All control mice showed recurrences within 3\u00a0weeks of post-resection while single Minnelide treatment delayed recurrence and one mouse was free of tumor. We provide evidence that Minnelide targets tumor intrinsic pathways and reprograms the immune suppressive microenvironment. Our studies also suggest that Minnelide in combination with cyclophosphamide may lead to durable responses in patients with basal/TNBC subtype warranting its clinical investigation."}

Using deconvolution approaches, we identify five subpopulations as independent prognostic markers, including states co-expressing TREM2 and PD-1, and FOLR2 and PDL-2.

Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) (blinded independent central review). Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment, overall survival (OS) and safety. Exploratory endpoints include ORR by PD-L1 subgroup and duration of response. PERLA met its pre-specified endpoint. ORR (n/N; 95% CI) is 45% (55/121; 36.4\u201354.8) for DCT and 39% (48/122; 30.6\u201348.6) for PCT (data cut-off: 07 July 23), numerically favoring dostarlimab in PD-L1-positive subgroups.

However, the heterogeneous nature of HER2+ breast cancer demands a deeper understanding of disease biology and its role in responsiveness to novel HER2-targeted agents, as well as non-HER2-targeted therapies, in order to optimize patient outcomes. In this Review, we revisit the mechanisms of action of HER2-targeted agents, examine the evidence supporting the use of dual HER2 blockade in patients with HER2-amplified tumours, and explore the role of biomarkers in guiding future treatment strategies. We also discuss potential implications for the future treatment of patients with HER2+ breast cancer."}

Seeking therapeutic approaches as well as screening tools to properly identify those patients with a higher risk of recurrence is therefore essential. Here, we report that the lipid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a predictor of long-term survival in patients with luminal BC, and that it blocks tumor progression and lung metastasis in cell and mouse models of BC. Together, our findings highlight the potential of FAAH as a biomarker with prognostic value in luminal BC and as a therapeutic target in metastatic disease."}

Molecular drivers of PCNSL have not been fully elucidated. Here, we profile and compare the whole-genome and transcriptome landscape of 51 CNS lymphomas (CNSL) to 39 follicular lymphoma and 36 DLBCL cases outside the CNS. We find recurrent mutations in JAK-STAT, NFkB, and B-cell receptor signaling pathways, including hallmark mutations in MYD88 L265P (67%) and CD79B (63%), and CDKN2A deletions (83%). PCNSLs exhibit significantly more focal deletions of HLA-D (6p21) locus as a potential mechanism of immune evasion. Mutational signatures correlating with DNA replication and mitosis are significantly enriched in PCNSL. TERT gene expression is significantly higher in PCNSL compared to activated B-cell (ABC)-DLBCL. Transcriptome analysis clearly distinguishes PCNSL and systemic DLBCL into distinct molecular subtypes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ CNSL cases lack recurrent mutational hotspots apart from IG and HLA-DRB loci. We show that PCNSL can be clearly distinguished from DLBCL, having distinct expression profiles, IG expression and translocation patterns, as well as specific combinations of genetic alterations."}

In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25\u2009\u00b1\u20094% versus 6\u2009\u00b1\u20092%, p-value 0.0002).

The downstream WNT target CD44 has demonstrated prognostic significance in gastric cancer (GC). This study evaluates the impact of AF1q on tumor stage and survival in GC patients. Immunohistochemical marker expression was analyzed and data were processed to correlation and survival analysis. Out of 182 GC samples, 178 (97.8%) showed moderate to high AF1q expression (p\u2009<\u20090.001), these samples correlated with positive lymph node stage (p\u2009=\u20090.036). In a subgroup analysis of patients with nodal-positive GC (n\u2009=\u2009129, 70.9%), enhanced tumoral AF1q expression resulted in impaired recurrence-free survival (RFS, p\u2009=\u20090.030). Enhanced tumoral CD44 expression resulted in impaired disease-specific survival (DSS) in the subgroup of patients with nodal-positive GC (p\u2009=\u20090.031) as well as in the overall GC group (p\u2009=\u20090.005). AF1q demonstrated as an independent prognostic marker for RFS (p\u2009=\u20090.035) and CD44 for DSS (p\u2009=\u20090.036). AF1q has shown potential for prognostication of RFS in GC patients and is predominantly expressed in nodal-positive GC. Testing AF1q provides a possibility of identifying patients with locoregional (and advanced) disease, particularly at risk for disease recurrence. Implementing AF1q into the diagnostic process may facilitate screening, prognosis estimation as well as consideration of preoperative multimodal treatment in patients qualifying for elective upfront surgery."}

In total, 101 patients with rare tumor entities or lesions and atypical manifestations of common tumors were enrolled retrospectively. Blinded readings were performed by four radiologists with varying levels of experience, who reported on: (a) correct diagnosis (CD), (b) time needed to find the diagnosis, and (c) diagnostic confidence, initially without followed by the assistance of the ORS. The experienced reader (3\u00a0years of experience post-residency, CD 49.5%), as well as the advanced reader with 1\u00a0year of experience post-residency (CD 43.6%), and a resident with 5\u00a0years of experience (CD 46.5%) made the correct diagnosis more frequently compared to the less experienced reader (CD 25.7%). A significant improvement in making the correct diagnosis was only achieved by the advanced reader, the resident with 5\u00a0years of experience (CD with ORS 58.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). The advanced reader with 1\u00a0year of experience post-residency improved slightly (CD ORS 47.5%). The experienced reader (CD ORS 50.5%) and the less experienced reader (CD ORS 27.7%) did not improve significantly. The overall subjective confidence increased significantly when ORS was used (3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 vs. 3.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9; p\u2009<\u20090.001). While the ORS had a positive impact on making the correct diagnosis throughout all readers, it favored radiologists with more clinical experience rather than inexperienced residents. Moreover, the ORS increased the diagnostic confidence of all radiologists significantly. In conclusion, the ORS had no significant impact on the diagnosis of rare or atypical abdominal tumors and lesions except for one reader. The greatest benefit is the increase in diagnostic confidence."}
{"title": "Evaluation of cosmetic outcomes in breast reconstruction patients undergoing radiotherapy using an anomaly generative adversarial network model", "published": "10 July 2024", "authors": ["Choong-won Lee", "Kyung Hwan Shin", "Ji Hyun Chang", "Bum-Sup Jang"], "abstract": "Considering the rising prevalence of breast reconstruction followed by radiotherapy (RT), evaluating the cosmetic impact of RT is crucial. Currently, there are limited tools for objectively assessing cosmetic outcomes in patients who have undergone reconstruction. Therefore, we validated the cosmetic outcome using a previously developed anomaly Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model and evaluated its utility. Between January 2016 and December 2020, we collected computed tomography (CT) images from 82 breast cancer patients who underwent immediate reconstruction surgery followed by radiotherapy. Among these patients, 38 received immediate implant insertion, while 44 underwent autologous breast reconstruction. Anomaly scores (AS) were estimated using an anomaly GAN model at pre-RT, 1st follow-up, 1-year (Post-1Y) and 2-year (Post-2Y) after RT. Subsequently, the scores were analyzed in a time-series manner, considering reconstruction types (implant versus autologous), RT techniques, and the incidence of major complications. The median age of the patients was 46\u00a0years (range 29\u201362). The AS between Post-1Y and Post-2Y demonstrated a positive relationship (coefficient 0.515, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The AS was significantly associated with objective cosmetic indices, namely Breast Contour Difference (P\u2009=\u20090.009) and Breast Area Difference (P\u2009=\u20090.004), at both Post-1Y and Post-2Y. Subgroup analysis stratified by type of breast reconstruction revealed significantly higher AS values in patients who underwent prosthetic implant insertion compared to those with autologous reconstruction at all follow-up time points (1st follow-up, P\u2009=\u20090.001; Post-1Y, P\u2009<\u20090.001; and Post-2Y, P\u2009<\u20090.001). A threshold AS of\u2009\u2265\u20091.9 was associated with a 10% predicted risk of developing major complications. The feasibility of an AS generated by a GAN model for predicting both cosmetic outcomes and the likelihood of complications following RT has been successfully validated. Further investigation involving a larger patient cohort is warranted."}

This is a retrospective study of 206 ovarian tumor patients. We conducted bivariate analysis to compare mean values of CA-125, LMR, NLR, and PLR with histopathology results. Multiple regression logistic analysis was then employed to establish predictive models for malignancy. NLR, PLR, and CA-125 exhibited statistically higher levels in malignant ovarian tumors compared to benign ones (5.56\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 vs. 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.58, 278.12\u2009\u00b1\u2009165.2 vs. 180.64\u2009\u00b1\u200989.95, 537.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091621.47 vs. 110.08\u2009\u00b1\u2009393.05, respectively), while lower LMR was associated with malignant tumors compared to benign (3.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 vs. 4.24\u2009\u00b1\u20091.78, p\u2009=\u20090.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that both PLR and CA125 emerged as independent risk factors for malignancy in ovarian tumors (P(z) 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Utilizing the outcomes of multiple regression logistic analysis, a nomogram was constructed to enhance malignancy prediction in ovarian tumors. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the significance of NLR, PLR, CA-125, and LMR in diagnosing ovarian tumors. PLR and CA-125 emerged as independent risk factors for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. The nomogram model offers a practical way to enhance diagnostic precision."}

However, studies on necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) and the regulating long non-coding RNAs (NRGlncRNAs) in the context of COAD are limited. We retrieved the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) to collect datasets of NRGs and NRGlncRNAs on COAD patients. The risk model constructed using Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was then employed to identify NRGs and NRGlncRNAs with prognostic significance. Subsequently, we validated the results using gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets from different populations, conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the potential causal relationships between prognostic NRGs and COAD, and conducted cell experiments to verify the expression of prognostic NRGlncRNAs in COAD. Furthermore, we explored potential pathways and regulatory mechanisms of these prognostic NRGlncRNAs and NRGs in COAD through enrichment analysis, immune cell correlation analysis, tumor microenvironment analysis, immune checkpoint analysis, tumor sample clustering, and so on. We identified eight NRGlncRNAs (AC245100.5, AP001619.1, LINC01614, AC010463.3, AL162595.1, ITGB1-DT, LINC01857, and LINC00513) used for constructing the prognostic model and nine prognostic NRGs (AXL, BACH2, CFLAR, CYLD, IPMK, MAP3K7, ATRX, BRAF, and OTULIN) with regulatory relationships with them, and their validation was performed using GEO and GWAS datasets, as well as cell experiments, which showed largely consistent results. These prognostic NRGlncRNAs and NRGs modulate various biological functions, including immune inflammatory response, oxidative stress, immune escape, telomere regulation, and cytokine response, influencing the development of COAD. Additionally, stratified analysis of the high-risk and low-risk groups based on the prognostic model revealed elevated expression of immune cells, increased expression of tumor microenvironment cells, and upregulation of immune checkpoint gene expression in the high-risk group. Finally, through cluster analysis, we identified tumor subtypes, and the results of cluster analysis were essentially consistent with the analysis between risk groups. The prognostic NGRlncRNAs and NRGs identified in our study serve as prognostic indicators and potential therapeutic targets for COAD, providing a theoretical basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COAD and offering guidance for further research."}

Feature selection was performed on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data using least absolute shrinkage and selection Operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Six ML algorithms were employed to construct the diagnostic models, which were evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves (PRC), and classification error (CE), and validated on the GSE7670 dataset. Additionally, a lasso cox prognostic model was built on the TCGA-LUAD dataset and externally validated using independent Gene Expression Omnibus datasets (GSE30219, GSE31210, GSE50081, and GSE37745). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to assess immune cell infiltration in stage I LUAD samples, revealing significant differences in immune cell types. These findings demonstrate a positive correlation between immune infiltration in stage I LUAD and Th2 cells, Tcm cells, and T helper cells, while a negative correlation was observed with Macrophages, Eosinophils, and Tem cells. These insights provide novel perspectives for clinical diagnosis and treatment of LUAD."}

This study focuses on exploiting telomerase, a critical SCLC dependency as\u00a0a therapeutic target. A prominent characteristic of SCLC is their reliance on telomerase activity, a key enzyme essential for their continuous proliferation. Here we utilize a nucleoside analog, 6-Thio-2\u2019-deoxyguanosine (6TdG) currently in phase II clinical trials, that is preferentially incorporated by telomerase into telomeres leading to telomere dysfunction. Using preclinical mouse and human derived models we find low intermittent doses of 6TdG inhibit tumor growth and reduce metastatic burden. Anti-tumor efficacy correlates with a reduction in a subpopulation of cancer initiating like cells (CICs) identified by their expression of L1CAM/CD133 and highest telomerase activity. 6TdG treatment also leads to activation of innate and adaptive anti-tumor responses. Mechanistically, 6TdG depletes CICs and induces type-I interferon signaling leading to tumor immune visibility by activating tumor cell STING signaling. We also observe increased sensitivity to irradiation after 6TdG treatment in both syngeneic and humanized SCLC xenograft models both of which are dependent on the presence of host immune cells. This study underscores the immune-enhancing and metastasis-reducing effects of 6TdG, employing a range of complementary in vitro and in vivo SCLC preclinical models providing a potential therapeutic approach to SCLC."}

First, a large multi-cancer training set that included 1,408 patients across 7 cancer types and 1,408 age- and gender-matched non-cancer controls was used to develop a 4-microRNA diagnostic model using 10-fold cross-validation. In three independent validation sets comprising a total of 4,875 cancer patients across 13 cancer types and 3,722 non-cancer participants, the 4-microRNA model achieved greater than 90% sensitivity for 9 cancer types (lung, biliary tract, bladder, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, glioma, pancreatic, and prostate cancers) and 75\u201384% sensitivity for 3 cancer types (sarcoma, liver, and ovarian cancer), while maintaining greater than 99% specificity.

The aim of this study is identifying prognostic factors and developing reliable nomogram to predict the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with PDLA. Patient data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was collected and analyzed. The SEER database was used to screen 1059 eligible patients as the study cohort. The whole cohort was randomly divided into a training cohort (n\u2009=\u2009530) and a test cohort (n\u2009=\u2009529). Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify variables and construct a nomogram based on the training cohort. C-index and calibration curves were performed to evaluate the performance of the model in the training cohort and test cohorts. For patients with PDLA, age at diagnosis, gender, tumor size were independent prognostic factors both for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), while race and number of nodes were specifically related to OS. The calibration curves presented excellent consistency between the actual and nomogram-predict survival probabilities in the training and test cohorts. The C-index values of the nomogram were 0.700 and 0.730 for OS and CSS, respectively. The novel nomogram provides new insights of the risk of each prognostic factor and can assist doctors in predicting the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year OS and CSS in patients with PDLA."}

A potential candidate for immunotherapy is interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine well known for its ability to mediate antitumor activity. We developed a plasmid encoding human IL-12 devoid of an antibiotic resistance gene (phIL12). For the approval of phase I clinical trials in basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the regulatory agency requires non-clinical in vivo testing of the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the plasmid. As human IL-12 is not biologically active in mice, a mouse ortholog of the plasmid phIL12 (pmIL12) was evaluated. The evaluation demonstrated the antitumor effectiveness of the protein accompanied by immune cell infiltration. The plasmid was distributed throughout the body, and the amount of plasmid diminished over time in all organs except the skin around the tumor. The therapy did not cause any detectable systemic toxicity. The results of the non-clinical evaluation demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the pmIL12/phIL12 GET, and on the basis of these results, approval was obtained for the initiation of a phase I clinical study in BCC."}

Additionally, aberrant glycosylation has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancers. However, the influence and underlying mechanism of N-glycosylation on the GSC phenotype and GBM malignancy remain elusive. Here, we performed an in-silico analysis approach on publicly available datasets to examine the function of N-glycosylation-related genes in GSCs and gliomas, accompanied by a qRT-PCR validation experiment. We found that high \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase MAN1C1 is associated with immunological functions and worse survival of glioma patients. Differential gene expression analysis and qRT-PCR validation revealed that MAN1C1 is highly expressed in GSCs. Furthermore, higher MAN1C1 expression predicts worse outcomes in glioma patients. Also, MAN1C1 expression is increased in the perinecrotic region of GBM and is associated with immunological and inflammatory functions, a hallmark of the GBM mesenchymal subtype. Further analysis confirmed that MAN1C1 expression is closely associated with infiltrating immune cells and disrupted immune response in the GBM microenvironment. These suggest that MAN1C1 is a potential biomarker for gliomas and may be important as an immunotherapeutic target for GBM."}

There is a need for identification of better prognostic markers beyond traditional clinical variables like grade and stage. Previous research revealed that abnormal expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and loss of the intestinal-specific Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) are linked to poor CRC prognosis. This study aimed to explore these markers\u2019 prognostic significance alongside two extraintestinal mucins (MUC5AC, MUC6), claudin 18, and MUC4 in 285 CRC cases using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs). CK7 expression and SATB2-loss were associated with MUC5AC, MUC6, and claudin 18 positivity. These findings suggest a distinct \"non-intestinal\" immunohistochemical profile in CRC, often right-sided, SATB2-low, with atypical expression of CK7 and non-colorectal mucins (MUC5AC, MUC6). Strong MUC4 expression negatively impacted cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20092.7, p\u2009=\u20090.044). Genetic analysis via next-generation sequencing (NGS) in CK7\u2009+\u2009CRCs and those with high MUC4 expression revealed prevalent mutations in TP53, APC, BRAF, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, and SMAD4, consistent with known CRC mutation patterns. NGS also identified druggable variants in BRAF, PIK3CA, and KRAS. CK7\u2009+\u2009tumors showed intriguingly common (31.6%) BRAF V600E mutations corelating with poor prognosis, compared to the frequency described in the literature and databases. Further research on larger cohorts with a non-colorectal immunophenotype and high MUC4 expression is needed."}

The prognostic significance of AR overexpression in gliomas remains unknown. AR mRNA expression in gliomas and relevant clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas databases. AR expression levels were compared across gliomas of different histopathologic grades and molecular subtypes. Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses in patients with different AR expression levels were investigated for the potential prognostic values of AR. Compared with normal brain tissue, gliomas show significantly higher AR mRNA expression (p\u2009<\u20090.01). AR mRNA expression was more prominent in higher grade disease and in worse prognostic molecular subtypes (p\u2009<\u20090.01). AR protein is more abundant in glioblastoma than in lower grade gliomas (LGG) (grade 2/3) (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). This is corroborated by a linear association between AR mRNA and protein expression (r\u2009=\u20090.65). In LGG, both higher AR mRNA and protein expression was associated with significantly worse overall survival (OS). Five-year OS for LGG patients with high versus low AR expression were 59.1% and 73.3%, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). AR expression is not prognostic for OS within glioblastoma patients. Gender was not associated with AR expression or prognosis. Higher AR expression levels are associated with higher grade disease and histopathologic features predicting poorer prognosis in lower grade gliomas. Higher gene expression in LGG patients is correlated with poor prognosis but not in the glioblastoma cohort suggesting saturated expression/functions of AR in glioblastoma."}

This study re-evaluates the survival paradox using the latest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data (released on April 17, 2024) to inform potential revisions to the staging criteria. Utilizing SEER data with 8th edition TNM staging criteria, 4692 colon cancer patients diagnosed between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed with chi-square test. Cox regression and Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis were employed to assess factors associated with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). The 3-year CSS rates for stage IIB and IIC were 73.1% and 70.3%, respectively, whereas stage IIIA had a substantially higher CSS rate of 91% (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, the OS rates were 64.9% and 63.0% for stage IIB and IIC, respectively, compared to 83.1% for stage IIIA (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analyses revealed stage IIIA patients had significantly lower risks of cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20090.374, 95% CI: 0.296\u20130.473, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and overall mortality (HR\u2009=\u20090.575, 95% CI: 0.483\u20130.685, P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to stage IIB patients. The upcoming 9th edition of the AJCC staging system should address this paradox by integrating advanced diagnostic markers and emphasizing the aggressive biology of T4 tumor, providing more accurate prognostic information and guiding more effective treatment strategies for colon cancer patients."}

The distinct subtypes of PeCa with an individual pathogenesis demand biomarkers for a precise patient risk assessment regarding disease progression and therapeutic susceptibility. We recently identified promising candidates associated with an HPV-instructed tumor microenvironment (TME) using HPV-positive PeCa cell lines and tissue microarrays (TMA). The capacity of HPV\u2009+\u2009p63\u2009+\u2009PeCa cells to release neutrophil-attracting CXCL-8 provided a molecular link explaining the infiltration of CD15\u2009+\u2009myeloid cells in PeCa specimens. The candidate biomarkers HPV, p63, CD15, DKK1, and CD147 linked a tumor-promoting TME with a higher TNM classification reflecting more aggressive and metastasizing cancers. Based on immune-reactive scores (IRS) from TMA staining for these biomarkers, we calculated correlations and conducted association analyses to assess the degree of relationship between all biomarkers. We then conducted Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates and Cox regression analyses to delineate the impact on PeCa patient survival. There is a notable predictive potential regarding the survival of patients with biomarker profiles beyond the potency of the individual biomarker. From all candidate biomarkers and biomarker profiles, the combination of CD147 and infiltrating CD15\u2009+\u2009cells linked to an active HPV-driven transformation displayed cancer-immune dynamics with dismal prognosis for patients. After deciphering relevant interdependencies, the HPV\u2009+\u2009CD147\u2009+\u2009CD15\u2009+\u2009status was the most potent profile predicting metastasis-free survival of PeCa patients. The results of this report underscore the need for analysis of the TME and the development of multi-parameter composite scores that reflect fundamental cancer-immune relationships to tailor therapeutic interventions based on actual cancer immune dynamics."}

Mobilizing dendritic cells (DC) and other myeloid cells with antigen presenting and cancer cell killing capacities is an attractive but not fully exploited approach. Here, we show that PIKFYVE is a shared gene target of clinically relevant protein kinase inhibitors and high expression of this gene in DCs is associated with poor patient response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Genetic and pharmacological studies demonstrate that PIKfyve ablation enhances the function of CD11c+ cells (predominantly dendritic cells) via selectively altering the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Both loss of Pikfyve in CD11c+ cells and treatment with apilimod, a potent and specific PIKfyve inhibitor, restrained tumor growth, enhanced DC-dependent T cell immunity, and potentiated ICB efficacy in tumor-bearing mouse models. Furthermore, the combination of a vaccine adjuvant and apilimod reduced tumor progression in vivo. Thus, PIKfyve negatively regulates the function of CD11c+ cells, and PIKfyve inhibition has promise for cancer immunotherapy and vaccine treatment strategies."}

However, the evaluation of ctDNA by amplicon-based NGS has been not endorsed by all the healthcare systems and remains to be fully integrated into clinical routine practice. To compare tissue single-gene with plasma multiplexed testing, we retrospectively evaluated 120 plasma samples from 12 consecutive patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC who were part of a prospective study enrolling treatment-na\u00efve patients and in which tissue samples were evaluated using a single-gene testing approach. While the plasma ctDNA detection of EGFR and BRAF mutations had an acceptable level of concordance with the archival tissue (85%), discordance was seen in all the patients in whom ALK alterations were only detected in tissue samples. Among six responders and six non-responders, early ctDNA mutant allelic frequency (MAF) reduction seemed to predict radiologic responses and longer survival, whereas increasing MAF values with the emergence of co-mutations like BRAFV600E, KRASG12V or TP53M237I seemed to be an early indicator of molecular and radiologic progression.

This study aimed to characterize tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in breast cancer (BC) and assess the influence of VD and its active metabolite, calcitriol, on their polarization. TAMs were isolated from BC patients and characterized. Monocytes were differentiated into macrophage classes (M0, M1, M2a, M2c) and treated ex vivo with calcitriol. The expression of VD-related proteins in tumor tissue was correlated with TAMs and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) characteristics. TAM expression of CD200R, CD204, CD80, HLA-DR, and CD44 was negatively correlated with CYP27B1 in selected patient groups. Patients with high CYP27B1 tumor expression showed significantly lower CD200R, CD204, and CD44 expression. In patients with normal VD levels and premenopausal, CD80 expression in M2a and M2c MDMs (control, untreated ex vivo with calcitriol) was negatively correlated with plasma VD. Calcitriol reduced HLA-DR during MDM differentiation in all patients; CD80 decrease significantly except in patients with normal VD levels or metastasis. Calcitriol also decreased CD163 expression. The decrease in both M1 and M2 macrophage markers by calcitriol or their negative correlation with CYP27B1 indicate the modulatory, but rather anticancer activity of VD. The intensity of these effects was the strongest in postmenopausal patients and those without metastases."}

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimal cutoff points for each parameter. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan\u2013Meier method and Cox regression analysis. Besides, the Inflammation Nutrition Risk Score (INRS) was calculated for each patient by assigning each independent prognostic factor a score of 1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that serum albumin (ALB), systemic immune-inflammation index, and monocyte count (M) were independent prognostic factors for OS (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Survival analysis showed that higher INRS was associated with a worsened prognosis. Patients in the high-risk group had shorter OS than in the low-risk group. In the training group, the 3-, 5-, and 8-years OS rates for the low-risk group versus high-risk group were 92.5% versus 87.8%, 87.4% versus 75.1%, and 84.6% versus 62.2%, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Further subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the OS between the high-risk group and low-risk group in patients with locally advanced disease (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The ROC curve demonstrated that INRS had a similar predictive value for long-term survival in NPC patients compared to TNM staging and serum EBV-DNA levels.

The aim of this study is to assess the dosimetric efficacy of online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) in comparison to image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for pancreatic cancer. We conducted a retrospective analysis involving 8 patients diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The gross tumor volume (GTV) delineates the visible extent of the tumor on imaging, while the planning tumor volume (PTV) was generated by expanding 5\u00a0mm from the GTV and ensuring a 3\u00a0mm distance from the small intestine, duodenum, and stomach simultaneously. Treatment planning was executed using the United Imaging Healthcare Treatment Planning System workstation. The control group underwent evaluation based on daily validated fan-beam CT (FBCT) scans, assessing both the dose delivered to actual organs at risk (OARs) and the target volume. Radiotherapy plans were developed utilizing simulation CT, and conventional radiotherapy with daily image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) was administered using FBCT-Linac. Conversely, patients in the study group received daily validated FBCT-guided adaptive radiotherapy plans, with a focus on mean dose assessment of both the target volume and OARs. Subsequently, we compared the average outcomes of each treatment fraction between IGRT and online adaptive radiotherapy (ART). Comparison between ART and IGRT treatment plans revealed significant differences in various dosimetric parameters: For PTV: V98%: ART (96.28%) vs IGRT (89.73%), p = 0.000, V95%: ART (96.28%) vs IGRT (89.73%), p = 0.031, V90%: ART (98.58%) vs IGRT (93.65%), p = 0.000, Dmean: ART (4912.91) vs IGRT (4804.11), p = 0.000.

For the Dmean of the left kidney and right kidney: Left kidney: ART (248.28) vs IGRT (239.65), p = 0.100. Right kidney: ART (314.55) vs IGRT (307.17), p = 0.345. These results suggest significant improvements in PTV coverage and sparing of OARs with ART compared to IGRT, indicating the potential of ART in optimizing treatment outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.\u00a0Compared to conventional IGRT-guided SBRT programs, ART-based SBRT for pancreatic cancer not only enhances the dose distribution to the target volume but also mitigates the radiation exposure to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) such as the duodenum, small intestine, and stomach. This approach may offer a more favorable safety profile while concurrently enhancing treatment efficacy."}

The aim of this study was to investigate late tissue responses in the salivary glands following proton- or X-irradiation of the head and neck in mice. Moreover, we aimed at investigating molecular responses by monitoring the cytokine levels in serum and saliva. Female C57BL/6J mice underwent local fractionated irradiation with protons or X-rays to the maximally tolerated acute level. Saliva and serum were collected before and at different time points after irradiation to assess salivary gland function and cytokine expression. To study late responses in the major salivary glands, histological analyses were performed on tissues collected at day 105 after onset of irradiation. Saliva volume after proton and X-irradiation was significantly lower than for controls and remained reduced at all time points after irradiation. Protons caused reduced saliva production and fewer acinar cells in the submandibular glands compared to X-rays at day 105. X-rays induced a stronger inflammatory cytokine response in saliva compared to protons. This work supports previous preclinical findings and indicate that the relative biological effectiveness of protons in normal tissue might be higher than the commonly used value of 1.1."}

We find that high CD8 GZMB+ and CD8 proliferating proportions and a low Macro CD5L+ proportion predict good response to the therapy. In patients with a poor response, the CD8 GZMB+ and CD8 proliferating proportions are increased, but the CD8 GZMK+ proportion is decreased after the therapy. Transition of CD8 proliferating and CD8 GZMB+ to CD8 GZMK+ facilitates good response to the therapy, while Macro CD5L+\u2013CD8 GZMB+ crosstalk impairs the response by increasing CTLA4 in CD8 GZMB+. Anti-CTLA4 antibody reverses resistance of the therapy in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Our data provide a resource for predicting response of the combination therapy and highlight the importance of CD8+T-cell status conversion and exhaustion induced by Macro CD5L+ in influencing the response, suggesting future avenues for cancer treatment optimization."}

We reviewed 452 cases from December 2013 to December 2023, analyzing clinical and imaging data. Key predictors of AVP-D included sex, tumor height, preoperative and postoperative changes in sellar diaphragm height and pituitary stalk length, preoperative ACTH levels, changes in ACTH levels, and preoperative cortisol levels. Six machine learning algorithms were tested: logistic regression (LR), support vector classification (SVC), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). After cross-validation and parameter optimization, the random forest model demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy (ACC) of 0.882 and an AUC of 0.96. The decision tree model followed, achieving an accuracy of 0.843 and an AUC of 0.95. Other models showed lower performance: LR had an ACC of 0.522 and an AUC of 0.54; SVC had an ACC of 0.647 and an AUC of 0.67; KNN achieved an ACC of 0.64 and an AUC of 0.70; and XGBoost had an ACC of 0.794 and an AUC of 0.91. The study found that a shorter preoperative pituitary stalk length, significant intraoperative stretching, and lower preoperative ACTH and cortisol levels were associated with a higher likelihood of developing AVP-D post-surgery."}

By taking advantage of the intersectionality of high-throughput cell-based and gene expression screens selective and pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) emerge as potent repressors of EVI1. To understand the mechanism driving on-target anti-leukemia activity of this compound class, here we dissect the expression dynamics of the bone marrow leukemia cells of patients treated with HDACi and reconstitute the EVI1 chromatin-associated co-transcriptional complex merging on the role of proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4) protein. PA2G4 overexpression rescues AML cells from the inhibitory effects of HDACis, while genetic and small molecule inhibition of PA2G4 abrogates EVI1 in 3q26 AML cells, including in patient-derived leukemia xenografts. This study positions PA2G4 at the crosstalk of the EVI1 leukemogenic signal for developing new therapeutics and urges the use of HDACis-based combination therapies in patients with 3q26 AML."}

In this single-arm, phase II study with Simon\u2019s two-stage design, we investigated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with early TNBC (NCT04213898). Eligible female patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed treatment-na\u00efve early TNBC were treated with camrelizumab (200\u2009mg, on day 1), nab-paclitaxel (125\u2009mg/m2, on days 1, 8, and 15), and epirubicin (75\u2009mg/m2, on day 1) every three weeks for six cycles. The primary end point was the pathological complete response; secondary endpoints included safety, objective response rate, and long-term survival outcomes of event-free survival, disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival. A total of 39 patients were enrolled between January 2020 and October 2021. Twenty-five patients achieved a pathological complete response (64.1%, 95%CI: 47.2,\u00a078.8). The objective response rate was 89.7% (95%CI: 74.8, 96.7), including 35 patients with partial responses. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 30 (76.9%) patients. In conclusion, the trial meets the prespecified endpoints showing promising efficacy and manageable safety of neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and epirubicin chemotherapy in female patients with early TNBC. Long-term survival outcomes are still pending."}

Here, we conduct a clinical study to validate the zebrafish patient-derived xenograft model (zAvatar) as a fast predictive platform for personalized treatment in colorectal cancer. zAvatars are generated with patient tumor cells, treated exactly with the same therapy as their corresponding patient and analyzed at single-cell resolution. By individually comparing the clinical responses of 55 patients with their zAvatar-test, we develop a decision tree model integrating tumor stage, zAvatar-apoptosis, and zAvatar-metastatic potential. This model accurately forecasts patient progression with 91% accuracy.

The prevalence of the melanoma-associated antigen chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) expression is ~70%, therefore effective immunotherapies directed at CSPG4 could benefit many patients. Since IgE exerts potent immune-activating functions in tissues, we engineer a monoclonal IgE antibody with human constant domains recognizing CSPG4 to target melanoma. CSPG4 IgE binds to human melanomas including metastases, mediates tumoricidal antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and stimulates human IgE Fc-receptor-expressing monocytes towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes.\u00a0IgE demonstrates anti-tumor activity in human melanoma xenograft models engrafted with human effector cells and is associated with enhanced macrophage infiltration, enriched monocyte and macrophage gene signatures and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment. IgE prolongs the survival of patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice reconstituted with autologous immune cells. No ex vivo activation of basophils in patient blood is measured in the presence of CSPG4 IgE. Our findings support a promising IgE-based immunotherapy for melanoma."}

To understand how microenvironmental characteristics alter immune homeostasis and limit immunotherapy efficacy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, here we establish a multi-center single-cell cohort based on public data, containing 357,206 cells from 50 patient samples. We reveal that nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells enhance development and suppressive activity of regulatory T cells via CD70-CD27 interaction. CD70 blocking reverts Treg-mediated suppression and thus reinvigorate CD8+ T-cell immunity. Anti-CD70+ anti-PD-1 therapy is evaluated in xenograft-derived organoids and humanized mice, exhibiting an improved tumor-killing efficacy. Mechanistically, CD70 knockout inhibits a collective lipid signaling network in CD4+ na\u00efve and regulatory T cells involving mitochondrial integrity, cholesterol homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, ATAC-Seq delineates that CD70 is transcriptionally upregulated by NFKB2 via an Epstein-Barr virus-dependent epigenetic modification. Our findings identify CD70+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells as a metabolic switch that enforces the lipid-driven development, functional specialization and homeostasis of Tregs, leading to immune evasion. This study also demonstrates that CD70 blockade can act synergistically with anti-PD-1 treatment to reinvigorate T-cell immunity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma."}

Previously, a correlation of desmosomal molecule expression with invasion and metastasis formation in several tumor entities was described together with a relevance for circulating tumor cell cluster formation. Here, we investigated the contribution of the desmosomal core adhesion molecule desmoglein-2 (DSG2) to the initial steps of liver metastasis formation by pancreatic cancer cells using a novel ex vivo liver perfusion mouse model. We applied the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line AsPC-1 with and without a knockout (KO) of DSG2 and generated mouse lines with a hepatocyte-specific KO of the known interacting partners of DSG2 (DSG2 and desmocollin-2). Liver perfusion with DSG2 KO AsPC-1 cells led to smaller circulating cell clusters and a reduced number of cells adhering to murine livers compared to control cells. While this was independent of the expression levels of desmosomal adhesion molecules in hepatocytes, we show that increased cluster size of cancer cells, which correlates with stronger cell\u2013cell adhesion and expression of desmosomal molecules, is a major factor contributing to the early phase of metastatic spreading. In conclusion, impaired desmosomal adhesion results in reduced circulating cell cluster size, which is relevant for seeding and attachment of metastatic cells to the liver."}

A previously completed phase I study of devimistat in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML showed promising response rates. Here we report the results of a single arm phase II study (NCT02484391). The primary outcome of feasibility of maintenance devimistat following induction and consolidation with devimistat in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone was not met, as maintenance devimistat was only administered in 2 of 21 responders. The secondary outcomes of response (CR\u2009+\u2009CRi) and median survival were 44% (21/48) and 5.9 months respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities observed. An unplanned, post-hoc analysis of the phase I and II datasets suggests a trend of a dose response in older but not younger patients. RNA sequencing data from patient samples reveals an age-related decline in mitochondrial gene sets. Devimistat impairs ATP synthesis and we find a correlation between mitochondrial membrane potential and sensitivity to chemotherapy. Devimistat also induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and turnover consistent with mitophagy. We find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mitochondrial fission or autophagy sensitizes cells to devimistat. These findings suggest that an age related decline in mitochondrial quality and autophagy may be associated with response to devimistat however this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts with proper trial design."}

Tumour cells usually hijack developmental signalling pathways to gain cellular plasticity and evade therapeutic targeting. In the present study, the secreted protein growth and differentiation factor 1 (GDF1) is found to be closely associated with poor tumour differentiation. Overexpression of GDF1 suppresses cell proliferation but strongly enhances tumour dissemination and metastasis. Ectopic expression of GDF1 can induce the dedifferentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells into their ancestral lineages and reactivate a broad panel of cancer testis antigens (CTAs), which further stimulate the immunogenicity of HCC cells to immune-based therapies. Mechanistic studies reveal that GDF1 functions through the Activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7)-Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (SMAD2/3) signalling cascade and suppresses the epigenetic regulator Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) to boost CTA expression. GDF1-induced tumour lineage plasticity might be an Achilles heel for HCC immunotherapy. Inhibition of LSD1 based on GDF1 biomarker prescreening might widen the therapeutic window for immune checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic."}

Mackey", "Paul Fieguth", "Parsin Haji Reza"], "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors are among the deadliest neoplasms with the lowest survival rates of any cancer type. In considering surgical tumor resection, suboptimal extent of resection is linked to poor clinical outcomes and lower overall survival rates. Currently available tools for intraoperative histopathological assessment require an average of 20\u00a0min processing and are of limited diagnostic quality for guiding surgeries. Consequently, there is an unaddressed need for a rapid imaging technique to guide maximal resection of brain tumors. Working towards this goal, presented here is an all optical non-contact label-free reflection mode photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) microscope. By using a tunable excitation laser, PARS takes advantage of the endogenous optical absorption peaks of DNA and cytoplasm to achieve virtual contrast analogous to standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In conjunction, a fast 266\u00a0nm excitation is used to generate large grossing scans and rapidly assess small fields in real-time with hematoxylin-like contrast. Images obtained using this technique show comparable quality and contrast to the current standard for histopathological assessment of brain tissues. Using the proposed method, rapid, high-throughput, histological-like imaging was achieved in unstained brain tissues, indicating PARS\u2019 utility for intraoperative guidance to improve extent of surgical resection."}

We retrospectively analyzed data from breast cancer patients treated at a major single-center breast hospital in China. From 2020 to 2022, we identified risk factors for BCRL through logistic regression and developed and validated a nomogram using R software (version 4.1.2). Model validation was achieved through the application of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), a calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA), with further evaluated by internal validation. Among 1485 patients analyzed, 360 developed lymphedema (24.2%). The nomogram incorporated body mass index, operative time, lymph node count, axillary dissection level, surgical site infection, and radiotherapy as predictors. The AUCs for training (N\u2009=\u20091038) and validation (N\u2009=\u2009447) cohorts were 0.779 and 0.724, respectively, indicating good discriminative ability.

This model does not require high technical proficiency, predominantly delivers cancer cells to bone marrow of hind limbs with much higher efficiency than IC injection, and greatly shortens the period of overt bone metastasis development. Moreover, CA injection barely causes acute death of mice, enabling us to inject a larger number of cancer cells to further accelerate the development of bone metastasis with a wide variety of cell lines. Our model may open a new avenue for understanding the bone metastatic processes and development of drugs preventing bone metastasis and recurrence."}

SECOMBIT (NCT02631447) was a randomized, three-arm, noncomparative phase II trial in which patients were randomized to one of two sequences with immunotherapy or targeted therapy first, with a third arm in which an 8-week induction course of targeted therapy followed by a planned switch to immunotherapy was the first treatment.

Primary outcome of overall survival was previously reported, demonstrating improved survival with immunotherapy administered until progression and followed by BRAF/MEK inhibition. Here we report 4-year survival outcomes, confirming long-term benefit with first-line immunotherapy. We also describe preliminary results of predefined biomarkers analyses that identify a trend toward improved 4-year overall survival and total progression-free survival in patients with loss-of-function mutations affecting JAK or low baseline levels of serum interferon gamma (IFNy). These long-term survival outcomes confirm immunotherapy as the preferred first-line treatment approach for most patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma, and the biomarker analyses are hypothesis-generating for future investigations of predictors of durable benefit with dual checkpoint blockade and targeted therapy."}

We successfully deploy the system in a non-interventional study comprising 89 global study clinical sites and demonstrate its potential to prioritize/deprioritize molecular testing resources and provide substantial cost savings in the drug development and clinical settings."}

Periodic Fasting mimicking diet (FMD) cycles are emerging as promising enhancers of a wide range of cancer therapies including immunotherapy. Here, either FMD cycles alone or in combination with anti-OX40/anti-PD-L1 are much more effective than immune checkpoint inhibitors alone in delaying melanoma growth in mice. FMD cycles in combination with anti-OX40/anti-PD-L1 also show a trend for increased effects against a lung cancer model. As importantly, the cardiac fibrosis, necrosis and hypertrophy caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors are prevented/reversed by FMD treatment in both cancer models whereas immune infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in myocardial tissues and systemic and myocardial markers of oxidative stress and inflammation\u00a0are reduced. These results indicate that FMD cycles in combination with immunotherapy can delay cancer growth while reducing side effects including cardiotoxicity."}

Both tumors exhibit significant heterogeneity, shaped by distinct genetic/epigenetic drivers, transcriptional programs including RNA splicing, and microenvironmental cues in glioma niches. However, the spatial organization of cellular states and niche-specific regulatory programs remain to be investigated. Here, we perform a spatial profiling of DMG and GBM combining short- and long-read spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell transcriptomic datasets. We identify clinically relevant transcriptional programs, RNA isoform diversity, and multi-cellular ecosystems across different glioma niches. We find that while the tumor core enriches for oligodendrocyte precursor-like cells, radial glial stem-like (RG-like) cells are enriched in the neuron-rich invasive niche in both DMG and GBM. Further, we identify niche-specific regulatory programs for RG-like cells, and functionally confirm that FAM20C mediates invasive growth of RG-like cells in a neuron-rich microenvironment in a human neural stem cell derived orthotopic DMG model. Together, our results provide a blueprint for understanding the spatial architecture and niche-specific vulnerabilities of DMG and GBM."}

Ueno", "Ningyan Zhang", "Zhiqiang An", "Kyoji Tsuchikama"], "abstract": "Breast tumors generally consist of a diverse population of cells with varying gene expression profiles. Breast tumor heterogeneity is a major factor contributing to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis after chemotherapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging chemotherapeutic agents with striking clinical success, including T-DM1 for HER2-positive breast cancer. However, these ADCs often suffer from issues associated with intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we show that homogeneous ADCs containing two distinct payloads are a promising drug class for addressing this clinical challenge. Our conjugates show HER2-specific cell killing potency, desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, minimal inflammatory response, and marginal toxicity at therapeutic doses. Notably, a dual-drug ADC exerts greater treatment effect and survival benefit than does co-administration of two single-drug variants in xenograft mouse models representing intratumor HER2 heterogeneity and elevated drug resistance. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of the dual-drug ADC format for treating refractory breast cancer and perhaps other cancers."}

The primary end point is overall survival at 3 months (OS3). Secondary end points include toxicity, cumulative time-to-progression at 3 months, and progression-free survival. A Simon two-stage design is used to compare a null hypothesis OS3 of 18% against an alternative of 44%. Median follow up based on patients still alive is 8.0 months (range: 0.5 to 15.9 months). The study has met its primary endpoint as 8 of 18 (OS3 0.44; 90% CI: 0.24 to 0.66) patients are alive at three months. One third of patients have experienced one (or more) grade-3 or higher adverse events.

The clinical benefit rate at 18 weeks was 28%, median progression free survival was 2.1 months and the median overall survival was 13.4 months. Toxicities were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Objective responses and/or prolonged survival were seen in patients with BAP1 wildtype tumors, and in one patient with an iris melanoma that exhibited a UV signature.

To examine the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with LMD, we completed two phase II clinical trials. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular features underpinning observed patient trajectories in these trials by applying single-cell RNA and cell-free DNA profiling to longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) draws from enrolled patients. We recover immune and malignant cell types in the CSF, characterize cell behavior changes following ICI, and identify genomic features associated with relevant clinical phenomena.

Immune cells interact with the tumor cells to shape this process. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to delineate the immune landscape and tumor heterogeneity in a cohort of patients with HBV-associated human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that tumor-associated macrophages suppress tumor T cell infiltration and TIGIT-NECTIN2 interaction regulates the immunosuppressive environment. The cell state transition of immune cells towards a more immunosuppressive and exhaustive status exemplifies the overall cancer-promoting immunocellular landscape. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of global molecular profiles reveals co-existence of intra-tumoral and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, but is more apparent in the latter. This analysis of the immunosuppressive landscape and intercellular interactions provides mechanistic information for the design of efficacious immune-oncology treatments in hepatocellular carcinoma."}

Because only a subset of patients experience clinical benefit, there is a strong need for biomarkers that are easily accessible across diverse practice settings. Here, in a retrospective cohort study of 1714 patients with 16 different cancer types treated with ICI, we show that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is significantly associated with poorer overall and progression-free survival, and lower rates of response and clinical benefit, after ICI therapy across multiple cancer types. Combining NLR with tumor mutational burden (TMB), the probability of benefit from ICI is significantly higher (OR\u2009=\u20093.22; 95% CI, 2.26-4.58; P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the NLR low/TMB high group compared to the NLR high/TMB low group. NLR is a suitable candidate for a cost-effective and widely accessible biomarker, and can be combined with TMB for additional predictive capacity."}

Here, we used the transcriptional master corepressor CtBP, which binds the putative metastasis suppressor RAI2 through repetitive SLiMs, as a model system. Using cryo-electron microscopy embedded in an integrative structural biology approach, we show that RAI2 unexpectedly induces CtBP polymerization through filaments of stacked tetrameric CtBP layers. These filaments lead to RAI2-mediated CtBP nuclear foci and relieve its corepressor function in RAI2-expressing cancer cells. The impact of RAI2-mediated CtBP loss-of-function is illustrated by the analysis of a diverse cohort of prostate cancer patients, which reveals a substantial decrease in RAI2 in advanced treatment-resistant cancer subtypes. As RAI2-like SLiM motifs are found in a wide range of organisms, including pathogenic viruses, our findings serve as a paradigm for diverse functional effects through multivalent interaction-mediated polymerization by disordered proteins in healthy and diseased conditions."}

In univariate and multivariate analyses, it was indicated that N0 patients had similar prognoses as N1 patients (P\u2009=\u20090.072), and the OS of both of these groups was significantly better than that of N2/N3 patients (N0 vs N2, P\u2009<\u20090.001; N0 vs N3, P\u2009<\u20090.001; N1 vs N2, P\u2009=\u20090.014; N1 vs N3, P\u2009=\u20090.005).

Using Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence analyses, as well as Cox and competing risk regressions, we assessed whether there is a relationship between sex and cataract surgery. In the general population, female sex was a significant risk factor for cataract surgery, with a 10-year incidence of 16% compared to 10% for males (subdistribution hazard ratio adjusted for age, 1.35, P\u2009<\u20090.001).

Visual acuity at the time of cataract surgery did not significantly differ between sexes in either cohort, suggesting that differences in surgery rates are not due to health-seeking behavior or surgery assessment thresholds. These findings indicate that female sex is associated with a higher risk of cataract surgery in the general population, but not among those treated with plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma."}

This retrospective case series consisted of 42 patients diagnosed with intraocular metastasis (IM) or ocular adnexal metastasis (OAM) at a tertiary center between January 2001 and June 2023. The patients comprised 18 men and 24 women; 24 (57%) and 18 (43%) patients were diagnosed with IM and OAM, respectively. In the IM group, the primary tumors originated from the lungs (79%), followed by the breasts (17%). In the OAM group, the primary tumors originated from the breasts (33%). Previously, 57% of the patients had been diagnosed with cancer. In the IM group, 38% exhibited bilateral involvement. Only 6% of the patients with OAM had bilateral diseases. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 42%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median OS since metastasis diagnosis in the lungs and breast was 11.8 and 10.5\u00a0months, respectively. Lung cancer remains the predominant primary cancer in IM, whereas breast cancer is the major cancer in OAM. Despite poor OS, early detection will facilitate the prompt treatment of primary cancer and metastatic sites."}

A total of 84 patients with peripheral hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract, who were treated cryoablation, were included in this retrospective study. Of these 84 patients, cryoablation had been performed in 39 patients with 41 peripheral hepatic tumors. These were assisted by induction artificial ascites while 40 patients with 43 peripheral hepatic tumors underwent cryoablation without induction of ascites. The artificial ascites separation success rate, the cryoablation technique effectiveness, local tumor progression and complications were all evaluated. The results showed that the artificial ascites separation success rate for 41 hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract was 95% (39/41). Technique effectiveness of group I was achieved in 35 of 43 tumors (81.3%) after follow-up imaging three months after cryoablation. In group II, technique effectiveness was achieved in 39 of 41 tumors after follow-up imaging three months following cryoablation. No major complications were encountered in either of the two groups. Artificial ascites assisting in CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is a reliable and effective method for the treatment of hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract, and it can achieve a fine local control of such tumors."}

Interestingly, post-hoc analysis shows that IFN-\u03b3 induction increases circulating chemokines and is associated with an observed paucity of irAEs, warranting further evaluation.

Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image\u2013based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n\u2009=\u2009394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n\u2009=\u2009284 and n\u2009=\u2009136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model\u2019s decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC."}

Here, in a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of 328 patients treated with CRT and durvalumab, we identify that very high PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) expression (\u2009\u2265\u200990%) and increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) are independently associated with prolonged disease control. Additionally, we identify the impact of pneumonitis and its timing on disease outcomes among patients who discontinue durvalumab: compared to patients who experienced early-onset pneumonitis (\u2009<\u20093 months) leading to durvalumab discontinuation, patients with late-onset pneumonitis had a significantly longer PFS (12.7 months vs not reached; HR 0.24 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.58]; P\u2009=\u20090.001) and overall survival (37.2 months vs not reached; HR 0.26 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.79]; P\u2009=\u20090.017).

Here we report a Phase I dose escalation trial (NCT02546921) with the primary objective of exploring the safety and tolerability of MOv18 IgE, a chimeric first-in-class IgE antibody, in patients with tumours expressing the relevant antigen, folate receptor-alpha. The trial incorporated skin prick and basophil activation tests (BAT) to select patients at lowest risk of allergic toxicity. Secondary objectives were exploration of anti-tumour activity, recommended Phase II dose, and pharmacokinetics. Dose escalation ranged from 70\u2009\u03bcg\u201312\u2009mg. The most common toxicity of MOv18 IgE is transient urticaria. A single patient experienced anaphylaxis, likely explained by detection of circulating basophils at baseline that could be activated by MOv18 IgE. The BAT assay was used to avoid enrolling further patients with reactive basophils. The safety profile is tolerable and maximum tolerated dose has not been reached, with evidence of anti-tumour activity observed in a patient with ovarian cancer. These results demonstrate the potential of IgE therapy for cancer."}

One of the reasons for the resistance is the internalization and recycling of PD-L1 itself upon antibody binding. The inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation of PD-L1 is critical for preserving the amount of PD-L1 recycling back to the cell membrane. In this study, we find that Hsc70 promotes PD-L1 degradation through the endosome-lysosome pathway and reduces PD-L1 recycling to the cell membrane. This effect is dependent on Hsc70-PD-L1 binding which inhibits the CMTM6-PD-L1 interaction. We further identify an Hsp90\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor, AUY-922, which induces Hsc70 expression and PD-L1 lysosomal degradation. Either Hsc70 overexpression or AUY-922 treatment can reduce PD-L1 expression, inhibit tumor growth and promote anti-tumor immunity in female mice; AUY-922 can further enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 treatment. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism of Hsc70-mediated PD-L1 lysosomal degradation and provides a target and therapeutic strategies for tumor immunotherapy."}

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death and is associated with anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy. Further investigations are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Ferroptosis-resistant GC cell lines are constructed. Dysregulated mRNAs between ferroptosis-resistant and parental cell lines are identified. The expression of SOX13/SCAF1 is manipulated in GC cell lines where relevant biological and molecular analyses are performed. Molecular docking and computational screening are performed to screen potential inhibitors of SOX13. We show that SOX13 boosts protein remodeling of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes by directly transactivating SCAF1. This leads to increased supercomplexes (SCs) assembly, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial energetics and chemo- and immune-resistance. Zanamivir, reverts the ferroptosis-resistant phenotype via directly targeting SOX13 and promoting TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of SOX13. Here we show, SOX13/SCAF1 are important in ferroptosis-resistance, and targeting SOX13 with zanamivir has therapeutic potential."}

In clinical practice, contrast-enhancing areas of diffuse gliomas in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are usually used to target biopsy, surgery, and radiation therapy, but there can be discrepancies between these areas and the actual tumor extent. Here we show that adding 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) to MRI sequences accurately locates the most malignant areas of contrast-enhancing gliomas, potentially impacting subsequent management and outcomes. We present a prospective analysis of over 300 serial biopsy specimens from 23 patients with contrast-enhancing adult-type diffuse gliomas using a hybrid PET-MRI scanner to compare T2-weighted and contrast-enhancing MRI images with FET-PET. In all cases, we observe and confirm high FET uptake in early PET acquisitions (5\u201315\u2009min after 18F-FET administration) outside areas of contrast enhancement on MRI, indicative of high-grade glioma. In 30% cases, inclusion of FET-positive sites changes the biopsy result to a higher tumor grade."}

In this study, we demonstrate that SLC25A22 underlies mutant KRAS-induced immune suppression in CRC. In immunocompetent male mice and humanized male mice models, SLC25A22 knockout inhibits KRAS-mutant CRC tumor growth with reduced myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) but increased CD8+ T-cells, implying the reversion of mutant KRAS-driven immunosuppression. Mechanistically, we find that SLC25A22 plays a central role in promoting asparagine, which binds and activates SRC phosphorylation. Asparagine-mediated SRC promotes ERK/ETS2 signaling, which drives CXCL1 transcription. Secreted CXCL1 functions as a chemoattractant for MDSC via CXCR2, leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Targeting SLC25A22 or asparagine impairs KRAS-induced MDSC infiltration in CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that the targeting of SLC25A22 in combination with anti-PD1 therapy synergizes to inhibit MDSC and activate CD8+ T cells to suppress KRAS-mutant CRC growth in vivo. We thus identify a metabolic pathway that drives immunosuppression in KRAS-mutant CRC."}

However, the efficacy and optimal administration of diuretics in preventing CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity remain to be established. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combining furosemide and mannitol to prevent CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. This was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from a multicenter, retrospective, observational study, including 396 patients who received one or two diuretics for CDDP-based chemotherapy, compared using propensity score matching. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for nephrotoxicity. There was no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between the two groups (22.2% vs. 28.3%, P\u2009=\u20090.416). Hypertension, CDDP dose\u2009\u2265\u200975\u00a0mg/m2, and no magnesium supplementation were identified as risk factors for nephrotoxicity, whereas the use of diuretics was not found to be a risk factor. The combination of furosemide and mannitol showed no advantage over a single diuretic in preventing CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. The renal function of patients receiving CDDP-based chemotherapy (\u2265\u200975\u00a0mg/m2) and that of those with hypertension should be carefully monitored. Magnesium supplementation is important for these patients. "}

Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is known to involve metabolic adaptation, however, the mechanism is not fully known. Here we show, by metabolic profiling of plasma samples from melanoma-bearing mice undergoing anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination therapy, that higher levels of purine metabolites, including inosine, mark ICB sensitivity. Metabolic profiles of ICB-treated human cancers confirm the association between inosine levels and ICB sensitivity. In mouse models, inosine supplementation sensitizes tumours to ICB, even if they are intrinsically ICB resistant, by enhancing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and hence generating an immunologically hotter microenvironment. We find that inosine directly inhibits UBA6 in tumour cells, and lower level of UBA6 makes the tumour more immunogenic and this is reflected in favourable outcome following ICB therapy in human melanomas. Transplanted mouse melanoma and breast cancer cells with genetic ablation of Uba6 show higher sensitivity to ICB than wild type tumours. Thus, we provide evidence of an inosine-regulated UBA6-dependent pathway governing tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity and hence sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition, which might provide targets to overcome ICB resistance."}

Here, we present a heavily pre-treated patient with triple-negative breast cancer (HER2 IHC 0 who had a complete response to T-DXd. In this case, we used a CLIA-certified reverse-phase protein array-based proteomic assay (RPPA) to determine that the patient had moderate HER2 protein expression (HER2Total 2+, 42%) and activation (HER2Y1248 1+, 23%). Using these results, we determined that the patient may benefit from T-Dxd despite being traditionally qualified as HER2 IHC 0. These findings highlight the potential for proteomics-based assays that may more accurately quantitate HER2 and (its activation) in the HER2 unamplified/IHC 0 setting to better select patients whose tumors are classically molecularly defined as HER2 IHC 0, but still could respond to HER2-directed therapy, and give patients access to therapies which for which they otherwise would not be eligible."}

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute the prominant population of immune cells in tumor tissues, contributing to the formation of CSC niches and a suppressive immune microenvironment. Here, we report that high expression of inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) in TAMs correlates with poor outcome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). ID1 expressing macrophages maintain cancer stemness and impede CD8+ T cell infiltration. Mechanistically, ID1 interacts with STAT1 to induce its cytoplasmic distribution and inhibits STAT1-mediated SerpinB2 and CCL4 transcription, two secretory factors responsible for cancer stemness inhibition and CD8+ T cell recruitment. Reducing ID1 expression ameliorates CRC progression and enhances tumor sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Collectively, our study highlights the pivotal role of ID1 in controlling the protumor phenotype of TAMs and paves the way for therapeutic targeting of ID1 in CRC."}

We demonstrate that a simple protocol enriches prostatic proteins in urine. Secreted and EV proteins arise from different subcellular compartments. Urinary EVs are faithful surrogates of tissue proteomes, but secreted proteins in urine or cell line EVs are not. The urinary proteome is longitudinally stable over several years. It can accurately and non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign prostatic lesions and can risk-stratify prostate tumors.

Here, we analyze the transcriptomic and immune-metabolic profiles of Dendritic Cells (DCs) from 35 subjects enrolled in a trial of DC vaccines in late-stage melanoma (NCT01622933). Multiple platforms identify metabolism as an important biomarker of DC function and patient overall survival (OS). We demonstrate multiple immune and metabolic gene expression pathway alterations, a functional decrease in OCR/OXPHOS and increase in ECAR/glycolysis in patient vaccines. To dissect molecular mechanisms, we utilize single cell SCENITH functional profiling and show patient clinical outcomes (OS) correlate with DC metabolic profile, and that metabolism is linked to immune phenotype. With single cell metabolic regulome profiling, we show that MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter-1), a lactate transporter, is increased in patient DCs, as is glucose uptake and lactate secretion. Importantly, pre-vaccination circulating myeloid cells in patients used as precursors for DC vaccine generation are significantly skewed metabolically as are several DC subsets. Together, we demonstrate that the metabolic profile of DC is tightly associated with the immunostimulatory potential of DC vaccines from cancer patients. We link phenotypic and functional metabolic changes to immune signatures that correspond to suppressed DC differentiation."}

There was not significant difference between volumes of GTV and CTV calculated from the ACT and pCT. However, significant differences in dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and coverage ratio (CR) between GTV and CTV were observed, with lower values for GTV volumes below 15\u00a0cc. The mean differences in dose corresponding to 95% of the GTV, GTV-P, CTV, and CTV-P between ACT and pCT were\u2009\u2212\u20090.32%, 4.52%, 2.17%, and 4.71%, respectively. For the dose corresponding to 99%, the discrepancies were\u2009\u2212\u20090.18%, 8.35%, 1.92%, and 24.96%, respectively. These differences in dose primarily appeared at the edges of the target areas. Notably, a significant enhancement of dose corresponding to 1\u00a0cc for spinal cord was observed in ACT, compared with pCT. There was no statistical difference in the mean dose of lungs and heart. In general, for lung cancer patients, anatomical motion may result in both CTV and GTV moving outside the original irradiation region. The dose difference within the original target area was small, but the difference in the planning target area was considerable."}

Despite the small sample size, which may limit the robustness of statistical analysis, the data suggest a higher observed risk with HPV16. These findings highlight the need for vigilant clinical management tailored to specific HPV genotypes and support the implementation of a nine-valent vaccine in Korea. Physicians should be aware of these genotype-specific risks when treating patients."}
{"title": "In silico analysis unveiling potential biomarkers\u00a0in gallbladder carcinogenesis", "published": "24 June 2024", "authors": ["Raviranjan Kumar Gupta", "Ravi Bhushan", "Saket Kumar", "Shyam Babu Prasad"], "abstract": "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare but very aggressive most common digestive tract cancer with a high mortality rate due to delayed diagnosis at the advanced stage. Moreover, GBC progression shows asymptomatic characteristics making it impossible to detect at an early stage. In these circumstances, conventional therapy like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy becomes refractive. However, few studies reported some molecular markers like KRAS (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma) mutation, upregulation of HER2/neu, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and microRNAs in GBC. However, the absence of some specific early diagnostic and prognostic markers is the biggest hurdle for the therapy of GBC to date. The present study has been designed to identify some specific molecular markers for precise diagnosis, and prognosis, for successful treatment of the GBC. By In Silico a network-centric analysis of two microarray datasets; (GSE202479) and (GSE13222) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, shows 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with GBC. Further network analysis revealed that 12 genes are highly interconnected based on the highest MCODE (Molecular Complex Detection) value, among all three genes; TRIP13 (Thyroid Receptor Interacting Protein), NEK2 (Never in Mitosis gene-A related Kinase 2), and TPX2 (Targeting Protein for Xklp2) having highest network interaction with transcription factors and miRNA suggesting critically associated with GBC. Further survival analysis data corroborate the association of these genes; TRIP13, NEK2, and TPX2 with GBC. Thus, TRIP13, NEK2, and TPX2 genes are significantly correlated with a greater risk of mortality, transforming them from mere biomarkers of the GBC for early detections and may emerge as prognostic markers for treatment."}

Partner genes and exons in most TK fusions are followed typical recurrent patterns, but the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these patterns are poorly understood. By developing Functionally Active Chromosomal Translocation Sequencing (FACTS), we discover that typical TK fusions involving ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 are selected from pools of chromosomal rearrangements by two major determinants: active transcription of the fusion partner genes and protein stability. In contrast, atypical TK fusions that are rarely seen in patients showed reduced protein stability, decreased downstream oncogenic signaling, and were less responsive to inhibition. Consistently, patients with atypical TK fusions were associated with a reduced response to TKI therapies. Our findings highlight the principles of oncogenic TK fusion formation and selection in cancers, with clinical implications for guiding targeted therapy."}

However, little is known about magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and the oncological impact of tumor localization in localized PCa with UH. Clinical data of 211 patients with acinar adenocarcinoma (conventional histology [CH]) and 82 patients with UH who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) were reviewed. Patients with UH are more likely to be older and have higher Gleason grade group, higher Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1 score, and larger tumor volume (TV) than those with CH. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of UH as an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ration (HR) 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22\u20130.79, P\u2009=\u20090.0073). No significant difference in PFS was seen regarding tumor localization (transition zone [TZ] or peripheral zone [PZ]) in patients with UH (P\u2009=\u20090.8949), whereas PZ cancer showed shorter PFS in patients with CH (P\u2009=\u20090.0174). PCa with UH was associated with higher progression than PCa with CH among resection margin (RM)-negative cases (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Further, increased PI-RADS v2.1 score did not correlate with larger TV in UH (P\u2009=\u20090.991), whereas a significant difference in TV was observed in CH (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). The prognostic significance of UH tumor was independent of tumor localization, and shorter PFS was observed even in RM-negative cases, indicating an aggressive subtype with micro-metastatic potential. Furthermore, UH tumors are more likely to harbor a large TV despite PI-RADS v2.1 score\u2009\u2264\u20093. These findings will help optimal perioperative management for PCa with UH."}

However, insufficient dose deposition and immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors limit its efficacy. Here we report a programmable sequential therapeutic strategy based on multifunctional fusogenic liposomes (Lip@AUR-ACP-aptPD-L1) to overcome the intrinsic radio-immunotherapeutic resistance of solid tumors. Specifically, fusogenic liposomes are loaded with gold-containing Auranofin (AUR) and inserted with multivariate-gated aptamer assemblies (ACP) and PD-L1 aptamers in the lipid membrane, potentiating melanoma-targeted AUR delivery while transferring ACP onto cell surface through selective membrane fusion. AUR amplifies IR-induced immunogenic death of melanoma cells to release antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for triggering adaptive antitumor immunity. AUR-sensitized radiotherapy also upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression that combined with released ATP to activate ACP through an \u201cand\u201d logic operation-like process (AND-gate), thus triggering the in-situ release of engineered cytosine-phosphate-guanine aptamer-based immunoadjuvants (eCpG) for stimulating dendritic cell-mediated T cell priming. Furthermore, AUR inhibits tumor-intrinsic vascular endothelial growth factor signaling to suppress infiltration of immunosuppressive cells for fostering an anti-tumorigenic TME. This study offers an approach for solid tumor treatment in the clinics."}

Seventy-nine patients (median age 6\u00a0years; 66 children with haematological malignancies) were included in the study. Overall, 362 blood samples were analysed, 72 from the time at diagnosis (11.1% with positive PCR result), 118 during a regular control after chemotherapy (11.0% positive), and 159 during FN (8.8% positive). The overall positivity rate was 9.6% (CMV 3.3%, HHV6 2.7%, HSV 2.2%, EBV 0.8% and adenovirus 0.3%). There were no significant differences between FN episodes with and without viraemia in terms of duration of fever or neutropenia/lymphopenia, severity of mucositis (>\u2009II0), incidence of diarrhea and ICU admission. Our results indicate that viraemia in paediatric cancer patients generally does not have a major clinical impact, and may help in the decision regarding the indication of routine evaluation for viraemia in febrile neutropenic, but otherwise asymptomatic children."}

Although minimally invasive irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation is a promising option for irresectable pancreatic cancers, the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment that characterizes this tumour type enables tumour recurrence. Thus, strengthening endogenous adaptive antitumour immunity is critical for improving the outcome of ablation therapy and post-ablation immune therapy. Here we present a hydrogel microsphere vaccine that amplifies post-ablation anti-cancer immune response via releasing its cargo of FLT3L and CD40L at the relatively lower pH of the tumour bed. The vaccine facilitates migration of the tumour-resident type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) to the tumour-draining lymph nodes (TdLN), thus initiating the cDC1-mediated antigen cross-presentation cascade, resulting in enhanced endogenous CD8+ T cell response. We show in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in male mice that the hydrogel microsphere vaccine transforms the immunologically cold tumour microenvironment into hot in a safe and efficient manner, thus significantly increasing survival and inhibiting the growth of distant metastases."}

Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and confocal microscopy, we find that cryopreserved NK cells largely die via apoptosis initiated by leakage of granzyme B from cytotoxic vesicles. Pretreatment of NK cells with a combination of Interleukins-15 (IL-15) and IL-18 prior to cryopreservation improves NK cell recovery to ~90-100% and enables equal tumour control in a xenograft model of disseminated Raji cell lymphoma compared to non-cryopreserved NK cells.

Performing transcriptomic and single-cell proteomic studies in healthy B-cell progenitors, we herein identify coordination between the glucocorticoid receptor pathway with B-cell developmental pathways. Healthy pro-B cells most highly express the glucocorticoid receptor, and this developmental expression is conserved in primary BCP-ALL cells from patients at diagnosis and relapse. In-vitro and in vivo glucocorticoid treatment of primary BCP-ALL cells demonstrate that the interplay between B-cell development and the glucocorticoid pathways is crucial for GC resistance in leukemic cells. Gene set enrichment analysis in BCP-ALL cell lines surviving GC treatment show enrichment of B cell receptor signaling pathways. In addition, primary BCP-ALL cells surviving GC treatment in vitro and in vivo demonstrate a late pre-B cell phenotype with activation of PI3K/mTOR and CREB signaling. Dasatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, most effectively targets this active signaling in GC-resistant cells, and when combined with glucocorticoids, results in increased cell death in vitro and decreased leukemic burden and prolonged survival in an in vivo xenograft model. Targeting the active signaling through the addition of dasatinib may represent a therapeutic approach to overcome GC resistance in BCP-ALL."}

The bone marrow stromal cells provide growth and survival signals, thereby promoting the development of drug resistance. Here, we show that the interaction between bone marrow stromal cells and myeloma cells (using human cell lines) induces chromatin remodeling of cis-regulatory elements and is associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in the cell migration and cytokine signaling. The expression of genes involved in these stromal interactions are observed in extramedullary disease in patients with myeloma and provides the rationale for survival of myeloma cells outside of the bone marrow microenvironment. Expression of these stromal interaction genes is also observed in a subset of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma and are akin to the transcriptional program of extramedullary disease. The presence of such adverse stromal interactions in newly diagnosed myeloma is associated with accelerated disease dissemination, predicts the early development of therapeutic resistance, and is of independent prognostic significance. These stromal cell induced transcriptomic and epigenomic changes both predict long-term outcomes and identify therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment for the development of novel therapeutic approaches."}

Here, we find an increased frequency of the L12_16 amino acid deletion mutation in the signal peptide region of NOTCH4 (NOTCH4\u0394L12_16) in EGFR-TKI-sensitive patients. Functionally, exogenous induction of NOTCH4\u0394L12_16 in EGFR-TKI -resistant LUAD cells sensitizes them to EGFR-TKIs. This process is mainly mediated by the reduction of the intracellular domain of NOTCH4 (NICD4) caused by the NOTCH4\u0394L12_16 mutation, which results in a lower localization of NOTCH4 in the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, NICD4 transcriptionally upregulates the expression of HES1 by competitively binding to the gene promoter relative to p-STAT3. Because p-STAT3 can downregulate the expression of HES1 in EGFR-TKI-resistant LUAD cells, the reduction of NICD4 induced by NOTCH4\u0394L12_16 mutation leads to a decrease in HES1. Moreover, inhibition of the NOTCH4-HES1 pathway using inhibitors and siRNAs abolishes the resistance of EGFR-TKI. Overall, we report that the NOTCH4\u0394L12_16 mutation sensitizes LUAD patients to EGFR-TKIs through transcriptional down-regulation of HES1 and that targeted blockade of this signaling cohort could reverse EGFR-TKI -resistance in LUAD, providing a potential approach to overcome resistance to EGFR-TKI -therapy."}

Here, we examine 170 GC whole genomes to unravel the oncogenic structural aberration landscape in GC genomes and identify six rearrangement signatures (RSs). Non-random combinations of RSs\u00a0elucidate distinctive GC subtypes comprising one or a few dominant RS that are associated with specific driver events (BRCA1/2 defects, mismatch repair deficiency, and TP53 mutation) and epidemiological backgrounds. Twenty-seven SV hotspots are identified as GC driver candidates. SV hotspots frequently constitute complexly clustered SVs involved in driver gene amplification, such as ERBB2, CCNE1, and FGFR2. Further deconstruction of the locally clustered SVs uncovers amplicon-generating profiles characterized by super-large SVs and intensive segmental amplifications, contributing to the extensive amplification of GC oncogenes. Comprehensive analyses using adjusted SV allele frequencies indicate the significant involvement of extra-chromosomal DNA in processes linked to specific RSs."}

Galli"], "abstract": "YAP is a key transcriptional co-activator of TEADs, it regulates cell growth and is frequently activated in cancer. In Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), YAP is activated by loss-of-function mutations in upstream components of the Hippo pathway, while, in Uveal Melanoma (UM), YAP is activated in a Hippo-independent manner. To date, it is unclear if and how the different oncogenic lesions activating YAP impact its oncogenic program, which is particularly relevant for designing selective anti-cancer therapies. Here we show that, despite YAP being essential in both MPM and UM, its interaction with TEAD is unexpectedly dispensable in UM, limiting the applicability of TEAD inhibitors in this cancer type. Systematic functional interrogation of YAP regulatory elements in both cancer types reveals convergent regulation of broad oncogenic drivers in both MPM and UM, but also strikingly selective programs. Our work reveals unanticipated lineage-specific features of the YAP regulatory network that provide important insights to guide the design of tailored therapeutic strategies to inhibit YAP signaling across different cancer types."}

Proteomic comparison between SCCs and ACs identifies distinguishable pivotal pathways and molecules in those pathways play consistent adverse or opposite prognostic roles in ACs and SCCs. A comparison between common and rare SCCs highlights lipid metabolism may reinforce the malignancy of rare SCCs.

Up to date, even if patients at high risk of transformation can be identified by the occurrence of Tumor Protein P53 (TP53) and Retinoblastoma Transcriptional Corepressor 1 (RB1) mutations in their tumors, no therapeutic strategies are available to prevent or delay histological transformation. Upregulation of the cell cycle kinase Cell Division Cycle 7 (CDC7) occurred in tumors during the initial steps of NE transformation, already after TP53/RB1 co-inactivation, leading to induced sensitivity to the CDC7 inhibitor simurosertib. CDC7 inhibition suppressed NE transdifferentiation and extended response to targeted therapy in in vivo models of NE transformation by inducing the proteasome-mediated degradation of the MYC Proto-Oncogen (MYC), implicated in stemness and histological transformation. Ectopic overexpression of a degradation-resistant MYC isoform reestablished the NE transformation phenotype observed on targeted therapy, even in the presence of simurosertib. CDC7 inhibition also markedly extended response to standard cytotoxics (cisplatin, irinotecan) in lung and prostate small cell carcinoma models. These results nominate CDC7 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to constrain lineage plasticity, as well as to effectively treat NE tumors de novo or after transformation. As simurosertib clinical efficacy trials are ongoing, this concept could be readily translated for patients at risk of transformation."}

Cancer incidence is primarily influenced by basically avoidable risk factors and an aging population. Through hypothetical elimination scenarios of multiple major risk factors for cancer, we estimated the number of new cancer cases that are\u00a0non-preventable in 2050. We compare numbers of new postmenopausal breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer cases in 2021 to projected numbers of new cases in 2050 under prevention scenarios regarding smoking, overweight and obesity, and alcohol consumption: no intervention, 50%, and 100% instant reduction. Cancer incidence data were derived from NORDCAN, and risk factor prevalence data from the Danish National Health Survey. Cancer projections were calculated with the Prevent program. Hypothetical 100% instant elimination of major risk factors for cancer in Denmark in 2022 will result in unchanged numbers of new breast and colorectal cancers in 2050. The number of new prostate cancers will increase by 25% compared to 2021. Unchanged risk factor levels will result in noticeable increase in cancer burden. Increase in life expectancy and age will entail an increase in cancer incidence, despite maximum effect of preventive actions in the population. Our results are important when planning future health care."}

The most successful treatments continue to combine decades old non-targeted chemotherapies with radiotherapy that unfortunately increase normal tissue damage in the irradiated field and have systemic toxicities precluding further treatment intensification. Therefore, alternative molecularly guided systemic therapies are needed to improve patient outcomes when applied with radiotherapy. In this work, we report a trimodal precision cytotoxic chemo-radio-immunotherapy paradigm using spatially targeted auristatin warheads. Tumor-directed antibodies and peptides conjugated to radiosensitizing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) specifically produce CD8 T cell dependent durable tumor control of irradiated tumors and immunologic memory. In combination with ionizing radiation, MMAE sculpts the tumor immune infiltrate to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibition. Here, we report therapeutic synergies of targeted cytotoxic auristatin radiosensitization to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses providing a rationale for clinical translational of auristatin antibody drug conjugates with radio-immunotherapy combinations to improve tumor control."}

Patient-derived organoids expand from highly proliferative LGR5+ tumor cells; however, we discovered that lack of optimal growth conditions specifies a latent LGR5+ cell state. This cell population expressed the gene MEX3A, is chemoresistant and regenerated the organoid culture after treatment. In CRC mouse models, Mex3a+ cells contributed marginally to metastatic outgrowth; however, after chemotherapy, Mex3a+ cells produced large cell clones that regenerated the disease. Lineage-tracing analysis showed that persister Mex3a+ cells downregulate the WNT/stem cell gene program immediately after chemotherapy and adopt a transient state reminiscent to that of YAP+ fetal intestinal progenitors. In contrast, Mex3a-deficient cells differentiated toward a goblet cell-like phenotype and were unable to resist chemotherapy. Our findings reveal that adaptation of cancer stem cells to suboptimal niche environments protects them from chemotherapy and identify a candidate cell of origin of relapse after treatment in CRC."}

A nationwide survey among breast cancer survivors was proposed in France, in collaboration with patient advocacy organizations, to assess their perspectives on personalizing ET and developing dedicated informative tools. This survey explored patients\u2019 preferences regarding ET intake schedule, formulation, presentation (color, taste, shape, size, design, and packaging), combination with agents targeting ET-related adverse events, and a mobile application to support them during ET. Of the 1103 individuals who started the survey, 939 (85.1%) were eligible for enrollment and completed the survey.

Patients with breast cancer receiving docetaxel (75\u00a0mg/m2)-containing regimens (n\u2009=\u2009111) were divided into 4 and 8\u00a0mg/day DEX groups, with each DEX dose administered on days 2\u20134, and analyzed retrospectively.

Moreover, its development in the first cycle was also lower in the 8\u00a0mg group than in the 4\u00a0mg group. These results were confirmed in a propensity score-matched population.

We then explored whether changes in serum inflammatory factor concentrations were related to BMI during the early postoperative period. We conducted a propensity\u00a0score-matched (PSM), retrospective cohort study at a specialized tertiary medical center. A total of 194 patients aged 18\u201380\u00a0years who underwent thoracic surgery for lung cancer at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between January and June 2021 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV during the first 48\u00a0h after surgery. Nausea, vomiting or retching at different time periods, severe pain, and concentrations of perioperative serum inflammatory factors including CRP, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3 were also assessed. Patients in the high BMI group (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0kg/m2) had a lower incidence of PONV than those in the normal BMI group (18.5\u201325\u00a0kg/m2) within the first 48\u00a0h after surgery (22 vs. 50%, p\u2009=\u20090.004). The incidence of nausea was lower at 0\u201312\u00a0h (14.5 vs. 37.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.004) and 12\u201324\u00a0h (8.1 vs. 22.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.025) in the high BMI group after surgery, and the incidence of vomiting was lower at 0\u201312\u00a0h (12.9 vs. 30.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.017) in higher BMI after surgery. We found no significant difference in the incidence of severe pain [severe static pain (p\u2009=\u20090.697) and severe dynamic pain (p\u2009=\u20090.158)]. Moreover, higher concentrations of IL-12 (2.24\u2009\u00b1\u20092.67\u00a0pg/ml vs. 1.48\u2009\u00b1\u20091.14\u00a0pg/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.048) and IFN-\u03b3 [1.55 (1.00) pg/ml vs. 1.30 (0.89)\u00a0pg/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.041] were observed in patients with normal BMI on the first day after surgery. Given this finding, patients with a normal BMI should receive more attention for the prevention of PONV than those with a high BMI following thoracic surgery for lung cancer."}

We calibrate the fluorescence intensities of individual compact quantum dots labeled with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and demonstrate the necessity of near-infrared emission to overcome intrinsic cellular autofluoresence at the single-molecule level. When applied to human triple-negative breast cancer cells, we observe proportionality between stimulation and both receptor internalization and inhibitor response, reflecting stimulation heterogeneity contributions to intrinsic variability. We anticipate that QDC-3DM can be applied to analyze any peptidic ligand to reveal single-cell correlations between external stimulation and phenotypic variability, cell fate, and drug response."}

We previously demonstrated the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in GBM cell migration and resistance to ionizing radiation. The atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3, responsible for CXCL12 scavenging, was previously suggested as additional important player in the context of GBM. Following validation of the detection tools, we observed that ACKR3 is expressed within GBM patient tumor tissue, distributed in diverse cell types. In contrast to CXCR4, ACKR3 expression in patient-derived stem-like cells (GSCs) remains however low, while ACKR3 gene expression by tumor cells appears to be modulated by the in-vivo environment. Using overexpression models, we also showed that in vitro ACKR3 had no significant direct effect on cell proliferation or invasion. Altogether, these results suggest that in vitro ACKR3 plays a minor role in malignant GBM cell biology and that its expression is possibly regulated by in-vivo influences. The subtle and multifaceted functions ACKR3 could exert in GBM should therefore only be tackled within a comprehensive tumor microenvironment considering tumoral but also non-tumoral cells."}

Our results emphasize the value of including radiomics data in integrative models of treatment response and provide methods for developing new biomarker-based clinical trials of NACT in HGSOC."}

Gemcitabine plus nabpaclitaxel (GnP) is the standard chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC); however, predictive markers for its efficacy remain unestablished. This study evaluated the association between GnP\u2019s therapeutic effects and Mcl-1 expression in tissue samples obtained using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for pancreatic tumor or percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy for metastatic liver tumor. We retrospectively reviewed 38 patients with histologically diagnosed MPC who received GnP as the first-line chemotherapy at our institute between December 2014 and July 2018. Post-immunohistochemistry analysis for Mcl-1 expression detection, patients were divided to into two groups based on the cell proportion showing Mcl-1 immunoreactivity: positive (>\u200920%; 23 [60.5%] patients) and negative (\u2264\u200920%; 15 [39.5%] patients) groups. Clinical characteristics did not differ between the two groups. The Mcl-1 positive group showed a significantly higher disease control rate (95.7% vs. 73.3%; P\u2009=\u20090.046), longer progressionfree survival (PFS) (7.2 months vs. 4.9 months; P\u2009=\u20090.018) and longer overall survival (OS) (14.9 months vs. 9.2 months; P\u2009=\u20090.008) than the Mcl-1 negative group. Multivariate analysis showed that Mcl-1 expression was an independent predictive marker for PFS and OS. Mcl-1 expression could be a predictive marker for favorable response to GnP."}

FOXA1 is crucial for the chromatin binding of the androgen receptor (AR) in both normal prostate epithelial cells and the luminal subtype of prostate cancer (PCa). Recent studies have highlighted the emergence of FOXA2 as an adaptive response to AR signaling inhibition treatments. However, the role of the FOXA1 to FOXA2 transition in regulating cancer lineage plasticity remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that FOXA2 binds to distinct classes of developmental enhancers in multiple AR-independent PCa subtypes, with its binding depending on LSD1. Moreover, we reveal that FOXA2 collaborates with JUN at chromatin and promotes transcriptional reprogramming of AP-1 in lineage-plastic cancer cells, thereby facilitating cell state transitions to multiple lineages. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of FOXA2 as a pan-plasticity driver that rewires AP-1 to induce the differential transcriptional reprogramming necessary for cancer cell lineage plasticity."}

However, variable tumour uptake and incomplete clearance of fluorescent dyes reduces the accuracy of distinguishing tumour from normal tissue via conventional fluorescence intensity-based imaging. Here we show that, after systemic injection of the near-infrared dye indocyanine green in patients with various types of solid tumour, the fluorescence lifetime (FLT) of tumour tissue is longer than the FLT of non-cancerous tissue. This tumour-specific shift in FLT can be used to distinguish tumours from normal tissue with an accuracy of over 97% across tumour types, and can be visualized at the cellular level using microscopy and in larger specimens through wide-field imaging. Unlike fluorescence intensity, which depends on imaging-system parameters, tissue depth and the amount of dye taken up by tumours, FLT is a photophysical property that is largely independent of these factors. FLT imaging with indocyanine green may improve the accuracy of cancer surgeries."}

Prayson", "Shideng Bao", "Jennifer S. Yu"], "abstract": "The Wnt pathway is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, underscoring it as a therapeutic target. Wnt inhibitors have uniformly failed in clinical trials. Here, we report a mechanism of WNT pathway activation through the Semaphorin 3\u2009C neurodevelopmental program in glioma stem-like cells. Sema3C directs \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation in a Rac1-dependent process, leading to transactivation of Wnt target genes. Sema3C-driven Wnt signaling occurred despite suppression of Wnt ligand secretion, suggesting that Sema3C drives canonical Wnt signaling independent of Wnt ligand binding. In a mouse model of glioblastoma, combined depletion of Sema3C and \u03b2-catenin partner TCF1 extended animal survival more than single target inhibition alone. In human glioblastoma, Sema3C expression and Wnt pathway activation were highly concordant. Since Sema3C is frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, Sema3C signaling may be a significant mechanism of resistance to upstream Wnt pathway inhibitors. Dual targeting of Sema3C and Wnt pathways may achieve clinically significant Wnt pathway inhibition."}

Activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSC) give rise to cancer-associated fibroblasts in HCC and are considered a potential therapeutic target. Here we report that selective ablation of stearoyl CoA desaturase-2 (Scd2) in aHSC globally suppresses nuclear CTNNB1 and YAP1 in tumors and tumor microenvironment and prevents liver tumorigenesis in male mice. Tumor suppression is associated with reduced leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (LTB4R2) and its high affinity oxylipin ligand, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHTrE). Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of LTB4R2 recapitulates CTNNB1 and YAP1 inactivation and tumor suppression in culture and in vivo. Single cell RNA sequencing identifies a subset of tumor-associated aHSC expressing Cyp1b1 but no other 12-HHTrE biosynthetic genes. aHSC release 12-HHTrE in a manner dependent on SCD and CYP1B1 and their conditioned medium reproduces the LTB4R2-mediated tumor-promoting effects of 12-HHTrE in HCC cells. CYP1B1-expressing aHSC are detected in proximity of LTB4R2-positive HCC cells and the growth of patient HCC organoids is blunted by LTB4R2 antagonism or knockdown. Collectively, our findings suggest aHSC-initiated 12-HHTrE-LTB4R2-CTNNB1-YAP1 pathway as a potential HCC therapeutic target."}

Here, we present a comprehensive two-step therapeutic approach in a male patient with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and heart transplantation followed with concomitant longitudinal analysis of systemic immunologic changes. In the first step, calcineurin inhibitor/ mycophenolic acid is replaced by the mTORi everolimus to achieve an improved effector T\u00a0cell status with increased cytotoxic activity (perforin, granzyme), enhanced proliferation (Ki67) and upregulated activation markers (CD38, CD69). In the second step, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) injection further enhances effector function by switching CD4 and CD8 cells from central memory to effector memory profiles, enhancing Th1 responses, and boosting cytotoxic and proliferative activities. In addition, cytokine release (IL-6, IL-18, sCD25, CCL-2, CCL-4) is enhanced and the frequency of circulating regulatory T cells is increased. Notably, no histologic signs of allograft rejection are observed in consecutive end-myocardial biopsies. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of T\u00a0cell activation and differentiation and suggest that timely initiation of mTORi-based primary prophylaxis may provide a dual benefit of revitalizing T\u00a0cell function while maintaining allograft tolerance."}

MOMA successfully predicts the overall survival, disease-free survival (log-rank test P-value<0.05), and copy number alterations of CRC patients. In addition, our approaches identify interpretable pathology patterns predictive of gene expression profiles, microsatellite instability status, and clinically actionable genetic alterations. We show that MOMA models are generalizable to multiple patient populations with different demographic compositions and pathology images collected from distinctive digitization methods. Our machine learning approaches provide clinically actionable predictions that could inform treatments for colorectal cancer patients."}

Here, we establish 5FU\u2009+\u2009CDDP resistant intestinal subtype GC patient-derived organoid lines. JAK/STAT signaling and its downstream, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), are shown to be concomitantly upregulated in the resistant lines. ADAR1 confers chemoresistance and self-renewal in an RNA editing-dependent manner. WES coupled with RNA-seq identify enrichment of hyper-edited lipid metabolism genes in the resistant lines. Mechanistically, ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing on 3\u2019UTR of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) increases binding of KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated 1 (KHDRBS1), thereby augmenting SCD1 mRNA stability. Consequently, SCD1 facilitates lipid droplet formation to alleviate chemotherapy-induced ER stress and enhances self-renewal through increasing \u03b2-catenin expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 abrogates chemoresistance and tumor-initiating cell frequency. Clinically, high proteomic level of ADAR1 and SCD1, or high SCD1 editing/ADAR1 mRNA signature score predicts a worse prognosis. Together, we unveil a potential target to circumvent chemoresistance."}

At 5 years after randomization, the estimated PFS rate is 62.6% after Ven-Obi and 27.0% after Clb-Obi. In both arms, MRD status at the end of therapy is associated with longer PFS. MRD\u2009+\u2009(\u2009\u2265\u00a010\u22124) status is associated with increased expression of multi-drug resistance gene ABCB1\u00a0(MDR1), whereas MRD6 (<\u200910\u22126) is associated with BCL2L11 (BIM) expression.

Also, we compared its performance against pathologists of varying expertise. Additionally, a human-machine fusion approach integrated both model and pathologic diagnostics. In external cohorts, LGNet achieved AUROCs of 0.965 and 0.972 in distinguishing PCNSL from glioma and AUROCs of 0.981 and 0.993 in differentiating PCNSL from non-PCNSL lesions.

Here we describe the association between TMB and survival outcomes among microsatellite-stable cancers in a real-world clinicogenomic cohort consisting of 70,698 patients distributed across 27 histologies. TMB was associated with survival benefit or detriment depending on tissue and treatment context, with eight cancer types demonstrating a specific association between TMB and improved outcomes upon treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 therapies. Survival benefits were noted over a broad range of TMB cutoffs across cancer types, and a dose-dependent relationship between TMB and outcomes was observed in a subset of cancers.

We aimed to compare the molecular and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) profiles of PDAC of the H vs. B/T. A total of 3499 PDAC samples were analyzed via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RNA (whole transcriptome, NovaSeq), DNA (NextSeq, 592 genes or NovaSeq, whole exome sequencing), and immunohistochemistry (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). Significance was determined as p values adjusted for multiple corrections (q) of <0.05. Anatomic subsites of PDAC tumors were grouped by primary tumor sites into H (N\u2009=\u20092058) or B/T (N\u2009=\u20091384). There were significantly more metastatic tumors profiled from B/T vs. H (57% vs. 44%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). KRAS mutations (93.8% vs. 90.2%), genomic loss of heterozygosity (12.7% vs. 9.1%), and several copy number alterations (FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, CCND1, ZNF703, FLT4, MUTYH, TNFRS14) trended higher in B/T when compared to H (p\u2009<\u20090.05 but q\u2009>\u20090.05). Expression analysis of immuno-oncology (IO)-related genes showed significantly higher expression of CTLA4 and PDCD1 in H (q\u2009<\u20090.05, fold change 1.2 and 1.3) and IDO1 and PDCD1LG2 expression trended higher in B/T (p\u2009<\u20090.05, fold change 0.95). To our knowledge, this is one of the largest cohorts of PDAC tumors subjected to broad molecular profiling. Differences in IO-related gene expression and TIME cell distribution suggest that response to IO therapies may differ in PDAC arising from H vs. B/T. Subtle differences in the genomic profiles of H vs. B/T tumors were observed."}

Here, we reveal that co-enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes (CPT1A, CPT2 and ACAD9) and immune checkpoint CD47 is dominant in recurrent GBM patients with poor prognosis. A glycolysis-to-FAO metabolic rewiring is associated with CD47 anti-phagocytosis in radioresistant GBM cells and regrown GBM after radiation in syngeneic mice. Inhibition of FAO by CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir or CRISPR-generated CPT1A\u2212/\u2212, CPT2\u2212/\u2212, ACAD9\u2212/\u2212 cells demonstrate that FAO-derived acetyl-CoA upregulates CD47 transcription via NF-\u03baB/RelA acetylation. Blocking FAO impairs tumor growth and reduces CD47 anti-phagocytosis. Etomoxir combined with anti-CD47 antibody synergizes radiation control of regrown tumors with boosted macrophage phagocytosis. These results demonstrate that enhanced fat acid metabolism promotes aggressive growth of GBM with CD47-mediated immune evasion. The FAO-CD47 axis may be targeted to improve GBM control by eliminating the radioresistant phagocytosis-proofing tumor cells in GBM radioimmunotherapy."}

Herein we perform in vivo shRNA screening to identify targets generally associated with radiation response as well as those exhibiting a genomic dependency. This identifies the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/EP300 as a target for radiosensitization in combination with radiation in cognate mutant tumors. Further in vitro and in vivo studies confirm this phenomenon to be due to repression of homologous recombination following DNA damage and reproducible using chemical inhibition of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), but not bromodomain function. Selected mutations in CREBBP lead to a hyperacetylated state that increases CBP and BRCA1 acetylation, representing a gain of function targeted by HAT inhibition. Additionally, mutations in CREBBP/EP300 are associated with recurrence following radiation in squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. These findings provide both a mechanism of resistance and the potential for genomically-driven treatment."}

Previously, our study group reported that patients experienced abdominal pain for several weeks after PIPAC-OX. However, it is unknown how this compares to abdominal pain after regular colorectal cancer surgery. To provide some perspective, this study compared the presence of abdominal pain after PIPAC-OX to the presence of abdominal pain after primary tumor surgery. Patient reported abdominal pain scores (EORTC QLQ-CR-29), from two prospective, Dutch cohorts were used in this study. Scores ranged from 0 to 100, a higher score represents more abdominal pain. Abdominal pain at baseline and at four weeks after\u00a0treatment were compared between the two groups. Twenty patients who underwent PIPAC-OX and 322 patients who underwent primary tumor surgery were included in the analysis. At baseline, there were no differences in abdominal pain between both groups (mean 20 vs. 18, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.688). Four weeks after treatment, abdominal pain was significantly worse in the PIPAC group (39 vs 15, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.001; Cohen\u2019s d\u2009=\u20090.99). The differential effect over time for abdominal pain differed significantly between both groups (mean difference: 19 vs \u2212\u20093, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.004; Cohen\u2019s d\u2009=\u20090.88). PIPAC-OX resulted in significantly worse postoperative abdominal pain than primary tumor surgery.

In this study, we used aspirin to prevent AOM/DSS-induced CRC in mice, and the anti-CRC efficacy of aspirin was assessed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and by determining the mouse survival rate and tumour size. 16S rDNA sequencing, flow cytometry (FCM), and Western blotting were also conducted to investigate the changes in the gut microbiota, tumour immune microenvironment, and apoptotic proteins, respectively. The results demonstrated that aspirin significantly exerted anti-CRC effects in mice. According to 16S rDNA sequencing, aspirin regulated the composition of the gut microbiota and dramatically reduced the abundance of Enterococcus cecorum. FCM demonstrated that there were more CD155 tumour cells and CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009Treg cells showed increased TIGIT levels. Moreover, increased TIGIT expression on Treg cells is associated with reduced Treg cell functionality. Importantly, the inhibition of Treg cells is accompanied by the promotion of CD19\u2009+\u2009GL-7\u2009+\u2009B cells, CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, CD4\u2009+\u2009CCR4\u2009+\u2009Th2 cells, and CD4\u2009+\u2009CCR6\u2009+\u2009Th17 cells. Overall, aspirin prevents colorectal cancer by regulating the abundance of Enterococcus cecorum and TIGIT\u2009+\u2009Treg cells."}

We first downloaded the clinical information and expression data of osteosarcoma samples from the UCSC Xena and GEO databases, of which the former was the training set and the latter was the validation set. Immune infiltration was assessed using the ssGSEA and ESTIMATE algorithms, and the osteosarcoma samples were divided into the Immunity_L and Immunity_H groups. Then, eleven RNAs were identified as the optimal prognostic RNA signatures using LASSO Cox regression analysis for establishing a risk score (RS) model. Kaplan\u2013Meier approach indicated the high-risk group exhibited a shorter survival. Furthermore, we analyzed the tumor metastasis, age, and RS model status were determined to be independent clinical prognostic factors using Cox regression analysis. Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the prognostic factor\u2009+\u2009RS model had the best net benefit. Finally, nine tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) showed significant differences in abundance between high- and low-risk groups via CIBERSORT deconvolution algorithm. In conclusion, the immune-related eleven-RNA signature be\u00a0could served as a potential prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma metastasis."}

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of eRNA AC003092.1 in KIRC. Clinical and RNA expression data were downloaded from a TCGA database, and performed bioinformatics analysis, including expression level analysis, survival analysis, clinical correlation analysis, immune correlation analysis. We further confirmed the expression level of AC003092.1 between normal and tumor cell, predicted the biological role of AC003092.1 in KIRC, and performed cell proliferation and wound healing assays, followed by GSEA enrichment analysis and western blot to detect the proteins of the enriched pathway. Bioinformatics results showed that AC003092.1 expression was elevated in tumor tissues, and knockdown of AC003092.1 expression inhibited cell proliferation and migration. GSEA and western blot results showed that knockdown AC003092.1 expression alleviated the extracellular matrix (ECM) process in KIRC cell lines. Our study provides evidence that AC003092.1 play an important role in KIRC, and AC003092.1 may promote tumor cell progression by affecting the ECM process during tumor development."}

Patients received guadecitabine 30, 45 or 60\u2009mg/m2/day subcutaneously on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks starting on week 0 for a total of four cycles, and ipilimumab 3\u2009mg/kg intravenously starting on day 1 of week 1 every 3 weeks for a total of four cycles. Primary outcomes of safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of treatment were previously reported. Here we report the 5-year clinical outcome for the secondary endpoints of overall survival, progression free survival, and duration of response, and an exploratory integrated multi-omics analysis on pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies. With a minimum follow-up of 45 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 28.9% and the median duration of response was 20.6 months. Re-expression of immuno-modulatory endogenous retroviruses and of other repetitive elements, and a mechanistic signature of guadecitabine are associated with response. Integration of a genetic immunoediting index with an adaptive immunity signature stratifies patients/lesions into four distinct subsets and discriminates 5-year overall survival and progression free survival. These results suggest that coupling genetic immunoediting with activation of adaptive immunity is a relevant requisite for achieving long term clinical benefit by epigenetic immunomodulation in advanced melanoma patients."}

Despite decades of clinical use, the mechanisms underlying resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we report that in B-ALL, GC paradoxically induce their own resistance by activating a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated cell survival pathway through the chemokine receptor, CXCR4. We identify PLC as aberrantly activated in GC-resistant B-ALL and its inhibition is able to induce cell death by compromising several transcriptional programs. Mechanistically, dexamethasone (Dex) provokes CXCR4 signaling, resulting in the activation of PLC-dependent Ca2+ and protein kinase C signaling pathways, which curtail anticancer activity. Treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist or a PLC inhibitor improves survival of Dex-treated NSG mice in vivo. CXCR4/PLC axis inhibition significantly reverses Dex resistance in B-ALL cell lines (in vitro and in vivo) and cells from Dex resistant ALL patients. Our study identifies how activation of the PLC signalosome in B-ALL by Dex limits the upfront efficacy of this chemotherapeutic agent."}

While the KEYNOTE-522 regimen employs AC every 3 weeks (q3w AC), previous studies have shown overall survival benefits of dose-dense regimens for early-stage breast cancer. The Neo-Real study (GBECAM-0123) is a real-world data effort evaluating patients with TNBC treated with neoadjuvant P\u2009+\u2009CT in ten cancer centers since July 2020. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of dose-dense AC (ddAC) versus q3w AC. Among 333 patients included until November 2023, 311 completed neoadjuvant therapy and 279 underwent surgery with pathology reports available; ddAC was used in 58.2% and q3w AC in 41.8% of the cases. Most patients (69.1%) had stage II TNBC. A pCR was observed in 65.4% with ddAC and 58.7% with q3w AC (P\u2009=\u20090.260), while RCB 0-1 occurred in 82.4% and 73.5%, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.115). Patients with stage III disease had a numerically higher pCR with ddAC (59% vs 40%, P\u2009=\u20090.155), while pCR rates were similar regardless of AC regimen in stage II disease (66.6% vs 64.5%; P\u2009=\u20090.760). While no significant disparities in drug discontinuation was noted, ddAC showed a trend towards higher rates of grade \u22653 AE (40.5% vs. 30.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.092). The Neo-Real study could not rule out a difference between ddAC and q3w AC during neoadjuvant P\u2009+\u2009CT. The observation of a potentially higher pCR with ddAC in stage III disease warrants further investigation."}

Cordyceps militaris, a traditional Chinese medicine, emerges as a promising candidate in this regard. This study investigates the effects of cordycepin and C. militaris ethanolic extract (Cm-EE) on sensitizing cancer cells and regulating immune responses against breast cancer (BC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Cordycepin, pentostatin and adenosine were identified in Cm-EE. Cordycepin treatment decreased HLA-ABC-positive cells in pre-treated cancer cells, while Cm-EE increased NKG2D ligand and death receptor expression. Additionally, cordycepin enhanced NKG2D receptor and death ligand expression on CD3-negative effector immune cells, particularly on natural killer (NK) cells, while Cm-EE pre-treatment stimulated IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 production. Co-culturing cancer cells with effector immune cells during cordycepin or Cm-EE incubation resulted in elevated cancer cell death. These findings highlight the potential of cordycepin and Cm-EE in improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy for BC and HCC."}

Mills"], "abstract": "Although Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved in multiple diseases, including BRCA1/2 mutant breast cancer, responses are usually transient requiring the deployment of combination therapies for optimal efficacy. Here we thus explore mechanisms underlying sensitivity and resistance to PARPi using two intrinsically PARPi sensitive (T22) and resistant (T127) syngeneic murine breast cancer models in female mice. We demonstrate that tumor associated macrophages (TAM) potentially contribute to the differential sensitivity to PARPi. By single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify a TAM_C3 cluster, expressing genes implicated in anti-inflammatory activity, that is enriched in PARPi resistant T127 tumors and markedly decreased by PARPi in T22 tumors. Rps19/C5aR1 signaling is selectively elevated in TAM_C3. C5aR1 inhibition or transferring C5aR1hi cells increases and decreases PARPi sensitivity, respectively. High C5aR1 levels in human breast cancers are associated with poor responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Thus, targeting C5aR1 may selectively deplete pro-tumoral macrophages and engender sensitivity to PARPi and potentially other therapies."}

To explore combinatorial strategies that can overcome these limitations, we perform an unbiased high-throughput screen in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line and identify thioredoxin1 (Trx1), a major component of the mammalian antioxidant-system, as a determinant of CHK1i sensitivity. We establish a role for redox recycling of RRM1, the larger subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), and a depletion of the deoxynucleotide pool in this Trx1-mediated CHK1i sensitivity. Further, the TrxR inhibitor auranofin, an approved anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug, shows a synergistic interaction with CHK1i via interruption of the deoxynucleotide pool. Together, we show a pharmacological combination to treat NSCLC that relies on a redox regulatory link between the Trx system and mammalian RNR activity."}

Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 39.4% of patients (26/66). In prespecified exploratory analysis, patients with altered SWI/SNF complex had a poorer PFS. Additionally, low serum CA724 level, high T-cell recruitment, low Th17 cell recruitment, and high NK CD56dim cell scores at baseline were potential predicative biomarkers for more favourable efficacy. In conclusion, PAAG as a first-line therapy demonstrated tolerability with promising clinical efficacy for mPC.

We evaluated HCC patients treated with selective TACE between July 2015 and March 2020, classifying post-procedure Lipiodol accumulation observed on CT scans into four distinct patterns: homogeneous, heterogeneous, defective, and deficient. We analyzed cumulative local tumor recurrence (LTR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates across these groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify potential prognostic factors influencing PFS and OS. Among 124 HCC nodules, the distribution of Lipiodol patterns was: 65 homogeneous, 24 heterogeneous, 10 defective, and 25 deficient. Median PFS was 33.2, 9.1, 1.1, and 1.0 months, respectively, while median OS spanned 54.8, 44.5, 25.0, and 29.1 months for these groups. A significant difference in survival was found only between the homogeneous and defective patterns (hazard ratio, 2.33; confidence interval 1.25\u20134.36). Multivariate analyses revealed nonhomogeneous patterns as significant predictors of shorter PFS (HR 6.45, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and OS (HR 1.73, p\u2009=\u20090.033). Nonhomogeneous Lipiodol patterns in HCC following TACE significantly correlate with higher recurrence and decreased survival rates, especially with defective patterns. Early detection of these patterns may guide timely intervention strategies, potentially enhancing survival outcomes for patients with HCC."}

This study aimed to investigate how CD151 and MMP9 affect TNBC cell migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that CD151 and MMP9 were positively expressed in triple-negative breast cancer, and lymph node metastasis, the histological grade, and CD151 and MMP9 expression were found to be independent prognostic factors for the survival of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Cytological experiments indicated that the knockdown of CD151 or MMP9 slowed triple-negative breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion and increased the apoptosis rate. Compared with CD151 knockdown, double MMP9 and CD151 knockdown further promoted cell death and inhibited TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, \u03b2-catenin and p-GSK-3\u03b2 were significantly downregulated. In summary, simultaneously silencing CD151 and MMP9 further suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells and promoted their apoptosis. One possible strategy for inducing this effect is to block the GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin pathway."}

{"title": "Targeting chromosomal instability in patients with cancer", "published": "11 July 2024", "authors": ["Duaa H. Al-Rawi", "Emanuele Lettera", "Jun Li", "Melody DiBona", "Samuel F. Bakhoum"], "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and a driver of metastatic dissemination, therapeutic resistance, and immune evasion. CIN is present in 60\u201380% of human cancers and poses a formidable therapeutic challenge as evidenced by the lack of clinically approved drugs that directly target CIN. This limitation in part reflects a lack of well-defined druggable targets as well as a dearth of tractable biomarkers enabling direct assessment and quantification of CIN in patients with cancer. Over the past decade, however, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms and consequences of CIN has greatly expanded, revealing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chromosomally unstable tumours as well as new methods of assessing the dynamic nature of chromosome segregation errors that define CIN. In this Review, we describe advances that have shaped our understanding of CIN from a translational perspective, highlighting both challenges and opportunities in the development of therapeutic interventions for patients with chromosomally unstable cancers."}

Here, we design bispecific BC19 CAR T cells targeting BCMA/CD19 and evaluate antimyeloma activity in vitro and in vivo. Preclinical results indicate that BC19 CAR specifically recognize target antigens, and BC19 CAR T cells mediate selective killing of BCMA or CD19-positive cancer cells. BC19 CAR T cells also exhibit potent antigen-specific anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse models. We conduct an open-label, single-arm, phase I/II study of BC19 CAR T cells in 50 patients with R/R MM (ChiCTR2000033567). The primary endpoint was safety. BC19 CAR T cells are well tolerated with grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome in 8% of patients and grade 1 neurotoxic events in 4% of patients, which meet the pre-specified primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate (92%), median progression-free survival (19.7 months), median overall survival (19.7 months) and median duration of response (not reached). Our study demonstrates that bispecific BC19 CAR T cells are feasible, safe and effective in treating patients with R/R MM."}

Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on freshly collected human PDAC samples either before or after chemotherapy. Overall, we find a heterogeneous mixture of basal and classical cancer cell subtypes, along with distinct cancer-associated fibroblast and macrophage subpopulations. Strikingly, classical and basal-like cancer cells exhibit similar transcriptional responses to chemotherapy and do not demonstrate a shift towards a basal-like transcriptional program among treated samples. We observe decreased ligand-receptor interactions in treated samples, particularly between TIGIT on CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells and its receptor on cancer cells, and identify TIGIT as the major inhibitory checkpoint molecule of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells. Our results suggest that chemotherapy profoundly impacts the PDAC TME and may promote resistance to immunotherapy."}

Here, we show that T cells expressing fibrinogen-like 2 (FGL2)\u2013specific single-chain variable fragments (T-\u03b1FGL2) can induce tumor-specific CD8+ TRM cells that prevent glioblastoma recurrence. These CD8+ TRM cells display a highly expanded T cell receptor repertoire distinct from that found in peripheral tissue. When adoptively transferred to the brains of either immunocompetent or T cell-deficient na\u00efve mice, these CD8+ TRM cells reject glioma cells. Mechanistically, T-\u03b1FGL2 cell treatment increased the number of CD69+CD8+ brain-resident memory T cells in tumor-bearing mice via a CXCL9/10 and CXCR3 chemokine axis. These findings suggest that tumor-specific brain-resident CD8+ TRM cells may have promising implications for the prevention of brain tumor recurrence."}

Here, we perform whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis of tumors from 22 patients with TP53 germline pathogenic variants. We observe somatic mutations affecting Wnt, PI3K/AKT signaling, epigenetic modifiers and homologous recombination genes as well as mutational signatures associated with prior chemotherapy. We identify near-ubiquitous early loss of heterozygosity of TP53, with gain of the mutant allele. This occurs earlier in these tumors compared to tumors with somatic TP53 mutations, suggesting the timing of this mark may distinguish germline from somatic TP53 mutations. Phylogenetic trees of tumor evolution, reconstructed from bulk and multi-region WGS, reveal that LFS tumors exhibit comparatively limited heterogeneity. Overall, our study delineates early copy number gains of mutant TP53 as a characteristic mutational process in LFS tumorigenesis, likely arising years prior to tumor diagnosis."}

Neuroblastoma (NB) arises from an inability of sympathoadrenal progenitors to exit a self-renewal program and terminally differentiate. To identify SEs driving TF regulators, we use all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to induce NB growth arrest and differentiation. Time-course H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq reveal ATRA coordinated SE waves. SEs that decrease with ATRA link to stem cell development (MYCN, GATA3, SOX11). CRISPR-Cas9 and siRNA verify SOX11 dependency, in vitro and in vivo. Silencing the SOX11 SE using dCAS9-KRAB decreases SOX11 mRNA and inhibits cell growth. Other TFs activate in sequential waves at 2, 4 and 8 days of ATRA treatment that regulate neural development (GATA2 and SOX4). Silencing the gained SOX4 SE using dCAS9-KRAB decreases SOX4 expression and attenuates ATRA-induced differentiation genes. Our study identifies oncogenic lineage drivers of NB self-renewal and TFs critical for implementing a differentiation program."}

Despite its initial report as a long non-coding RNA, the TINCR locus codes for a highly conserved ubiquitin-like microprotein associated with keratinocyte differentiation. Here we report the identification of TINCR as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). TINCR is upregulated by UV-induced DNA damage in a TP53-dependent manner in human keratinocytes. Decreased TINCR protein expression is prevalently found in skin and head and neck squamous cell tumors and TINCR expression suppresses the growth of SCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Tincr knockout mice show accelerated tumor development following UVB skin carcinogenesis and increased penetrance of invasive SCCs. Finally, genetic analyses identify loss-of-function mutations and deletions encompassing the TINCR gene in SCC clinical samples supporting a tumor suppressor role in human cancer. Altogether, these results demonstrate a role for TINCR as protein coding tumor suppressor gene recurrently lost in squamous cell carcinomas."}

To examine the contribution of the immune microenvironment to antitumor efficacy, we characterized the effects of POL\u03b8 inhibition in immunocompetent models of BRCA1-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or BRCA2-deficient pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that genetic POLQ depletion or pharmacological POL\u03b8 inhibition induces both innate and adaptive immune responses in these models. POL\u03b8 inhibition resulted in increased micronuclei, cGAS/STING pathway activation, type I interferon gene expression, CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, local paracrine activation of dendritic cells and upregulation of PD-L1 expression. Depletion of CD8+ T cells compromised the efficacy of POL\u03b8 inhibition, whereas antitumor effects were augmented in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that POL\u03b8 inhibition induces immune responses in a cGAS/STING-dependent manner and provide a rationale for combining POL\u03b8 inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade for the treatment of HR-deficient cancers."}

Premetastatic niche (PMN) and macrometastatic niche (MMN) formation in a mouse model is observed via CT combined with 3D organ reconstruction bioluminescence imaging, and then we screen slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2) and its receptor roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) as important factors. After we confirm the expression and distribution of SLIT2 and ROBO1 in samples from PDAC patients and several mouse models, we discover that SLIT2-ROBO1-mediated coadaptation facilitated the implantation and outgrowth of PDAC disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in the liver. We also demonstrate the dependence receptor (DR) characteristics of ROBO1 in a follow-up mechanistic study. A neutralizing antibody targeting ROBO1 significantly attenuate liver metastasis of PDAC by preventing the coadaptation effect. Thus, we demonstrate that coadaptation is supported by the DR characteristics in the PMN and MMN."}

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic agents have shown activity in late-stage gastric cancer, but their efficacy in the neoadjuvant/conversion setting is unclear. In this single-armed, phase II, exploratory trial (NCT03878472), we evaluate the efficacy of a combination of ICI (camrelizumab), antiangiogenesis (apatinib), and chemotherapy (S-1 \u00b1 oxaliplatin) for neoadjuvant/conversion treatment of cT4a/bN+ gastric cancer. The primary endpoints are pathological responses and their potential biomarkers. Secondary endpoints include safety, objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Complete and major pathological response rates are 15.8% and 26.3%. Pathological responses correlate significantly with microsatellite instability status, PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutational burden. In addition, multi-omics examination reveals several putative biomarkers for pathological responses, including RREB1 and SSPO mutation, immune-related signatures, and a peripheral T cell expansion score. Multi-omics also demonstrates dynamic changes in dominant tumor subclones, immune microenvironments, and T cell receptor repertoires during neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The toxicity and post-surgery complications are limited. These data support further validation of ICI- and antiangiogenesis-based neoadjuvant/conversion therapy in large randomized trials and provide candidate biomarkers."}

Using clinical-practice ultrasound elastography for patients\u2019 lesions and atomic force microscopy for surgical samples, we reveal that increased matrix stiffness is associated with poor responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, worse prognosis, and CSC enrichment in patients with breast cancer. Mechanically, TAZ activated by biomechanics enhances CSC properties via phase separation with NANOG. TAZ-NANOG phase separation, which is dependent on acidic residues in the N-terminal activation domain of NANOG, promotes the transcription of SOX2 and OCT4. Therapeutically, targeting NANOG or TAZ reduces CSCs and enhances the chemosensitivity in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the phase separation of a pluripotency transcription factor links mechanical cues in the niche to the fate of CSCs."}

We find 243 and 121 significantly dysregulated proteins from PM vs. PB and PM vs. AM, respectively. Function and pathway analyses show the enhanced activation of the inflammatory and immune system in PM patients compared with the others. Nineteen proteins are selected to predict recurrence using a machine learning model with an accuracy of 88.24%.

Franco", "Romina Tejada", "Salvatore Vaccarella"], "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the first cancer deemed amenable to elimination through prevention, and thus lessons from the epidemiology and prevention of this cancer type can provide information on strategies to manage other cancers. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) causes virtually all cervical cancers, and an important proportion of oropharyngeal, anal and genital cancers. Whereas 20th century prevention efforts were dominated by cytology-based screening, the present and future of HPV-associated cancer prevention relies mostly on HPV vaccination and molecular screening tests. In this Review, we provide an overview of the epidemiology of HPV-associated cancers, their disease burden, how past and contemporary preventive interventions have shaped their incidence and mortality, and the potential for elimination. We particularly focus on the cofactors that could have the greatest effect on prevention efforts, such as parity and human immunodeficiency virus infection, as well as on social determinants of health. Given that the incidence of and mortality from HPV-associated cancers remain strongly associated with the socioeconomic status of individuals and the human development index of countries, elimination efforts are unlikely to succeed unless prevention efforts focus on health equity, with a commitment to both primary and secondary prevention."}

Here we identify the RBP RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked (RBMX; also known as hnRNPG), and its retrogene RBMXL1 to be required for murine and human myeloid leukemogenesis. RBMX and RBMXL1 were overexpressed in individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to healthy individuals, and RBMX/RBMXL1 loss delayed leukemia development. RBMX/RBMXL1 loss lead to global changes in chromatin accessibility as well as chromosomal breaks and gaps. We found that RBMX and RBMXL1 directly bind to mRNAs, affect transcription of multiple loci, including CBX5 (also known as heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1-\u03b1)), and control the nascent transcription of the CBX5 locus. Forced CBX5 expression rescued the RBMX/RBMXL1 depletion effects on cell growth and apoptosis. Overall, we determined that RBMX and RBMXL1 control leukemia cell survival by regulating chromatin state through the downstream target CBX5. These findings identify a mechanism for RBPs directly promoting transcription and suggest RBMX and RBMXL1, as well as CBX5, as potential therapeutic targets in myeloid malignancies."}

The univariate Cox regression and Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis were conducted to determine potential prognostic genes from the training cohort. These potential prognostic genes underwent a LASSO regression, which then generated a gene signature. The harvested signature\u2019s predictive ability was further examined by the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis, Cox analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve). More importantly, we listed similar studies in the most recent year and compared theirs with ours. Finally, we performed functional annotation, immune relevant signature correlation identification, and immune infiltrating analysis to better study he functional mechanism of the signature and the immune cells\u2019 roles in the gene signature\u2019s prognosis ability. A seventeen-gene signature (UBE2L3, PLD3, SLC45A4, CLTC, CTNNBIP1, FBXL5, MKL2, SELPLG, C3orf14, WDR53, ZFP90, UHRF2, ARX, CORT, DDX26B, MYC, and SLC16A3) was generated from the LASSO regression. The signature was then confirmed having strong and stable prognostic capacity in all studied cohorts by several statistical methods. We revealed the superiority of our signature after comparing it to our predecessors, and the GO and KEGG annotations uncovered the specifically mechanism of action related to the gene signature. Six immune signatures, including PRF1, CD8A, HAVCR2, LAG3, CD274, and GZMA were identified associating with our signature. The immune-infiltrating analysis recognized the vital roles of T cells CD8 and Mast cells activated, which potentially support the seventeen-gene signature\u2019s prognosis ability. We identified a robust seventeen-gene signature that can accurately predict OS prognosis. We identified potential immunotherapy targets to the gene signature.

Genomic aberrations along with EBV-encoded LMP1 expression underpin constitutive NF-\u03baB activation in 90% of NPCs. A similar spectrum of somatic aberrations and viral gene expression undermine innate immunity in 79% of cases and adaptive immunity in 47% of cases; mechanisms by which NPC may evade immune surveillance despite its pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, genomic changes impairing TGFBR2 promote oncogenesis and stabilize EBV infection in tumor cells. Fine-mapping of CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion breakpoints reveals homozygous MTAP deletions in 32-34% of NPCs that confer marked sensitivity to MAT2A inhibition.

Patients from 12 referral Italian hospitals with HR+/HER2\u2212 aBC who received abemaciclib were included. Clinical data about comorbidities, concurrent medications, outcomes, and adverse events (AE) were collected. Drug-PIN\u00ae (Personalized Interactions Network) is a tool recognizing the role of multiple interactions between active and/or pro-drug forms combined with biochemical and demographic patient data. The software was used to define the Drug-PIN score and Drug-PIN tier (green, yellow, dark yellow, and red) for each patient. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of patients\u2019 PFS or toxicity. One hundred seventy-three patients were included. 13% of patients had >75years. The overall response rate (ORR) was 63%. The general population\u2019s median PFS (mPFS) was 22 months (mo), while mOS were not reached. Patients treated with abemaciclib in combination with AI and fulvestrant had a mPFS of 36 and 19 mo, respectively. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, asthenia, and neutropenia detected in 63%,49%, and 49% of patients. The number of concomitant medications and comorbidities were not associated with survival outcomes (22 vs 17 mo, p\u2009=\u20090.068, p\u2009=\u20090.99). Drug-PIN tier from dark yellow to red and Drug-PIN score >12 were associated with shorter PFS compared to no/low-risk DDIs and score <12 (15 vs 23, p\u2009=\u20090.005, p\u2009=\u20090.0017). Drug interaction was confirmed as an independent biomarker in a multivariate model (p\u2009=\u20090.02). No difference in any grade AE, severe toxicities, and diarrhea were detected among different age subgroups. No association was found between Drug-PIN score or Drug-PIN tier and overall toxicity (p\u2009=\u20090.44), severe AEs (p\u2009=\u20090.11), or drug reduction (p\u2009=\u20090.27).

Pulmonary nodule SUVmax was significantly higher in BSREM images compared to OSEM images [BSREM 5.4 (1.2\u201320.7), OSEM 3.6 (0.7\u201317.4); p\u2009=\u20090.0001]. In a size-based analysis, the relative increase in SUVmax was more pronounced in smaller nodules (\u2264\u20097\u00a0mm) as compared to larger nodules (8\u201310\u00a0mm, or\u2009>\u200910\u00a0mm). Lesion conspicuity was higher in BSREM than in OSEM (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). BSREM reconstruction results in a significant increase in SUVmax and a significantly improved conspicuity of small 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules compared to OSEM reconstruction. Digital 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT reading may be enhanced with BSREM as small lesion conspicuity is improved."}

Solid and basaloid adenoid cystic carcinoma (SB-AdCC) is considered a sparse variant of AdCC. This study sought to search for clinicopathological and genomic features in SB-AdCC. Registered clinicopathological data on a cohort of 13 AdCC of the breast cases, including six conventional adenoid cystic carcinoma (C-AdCC) cases and seven SB-AdCC cases, were collected. MYB gene rearrangement via fluorescent in situ hybridization was investigated and MYB protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Compared with C-AdCC, we found that the distribution of SB-AdCC cases were shifted to older age and were more frequently distant metastasis. Moreover, metastasis cases also showed a high (exceed 30%) Ki-67 index. Both groups showed MYB rearrangements and MYB protein expression, but they were less frequent in SB-AdCC than C-AdCC. To conclude, our results suggest that SB-AdCC is an aggressive variant of mammary AdCC with a higher incidence of distant metastases compared with C-AdCC, though they share common molecular features. A high Ki-67 index may be an adverse prognostic factor for metastasis."}

We investigated overall and subgroup-specific female breast cancer rates to provide a comprehensive analysis of trends over several decades. Incidence, mortality, and survival, as well as age-, stage-, and birth cohort-specific incidence were analysed using nationwide cancer registry data on 163,694 cases of female breast cancer in Austria (1983\u20132017). Annual percentage changes were estimated using joinpoint regression. BC incidence underwent linear increases until 1997 and reversed with statistically non-significant declines until 2017. After initial increases in BC-specific mortality, rates were stable from 1989 through 1995 and started declining thereafter, although statistically non-significantly after 2011. Overall BC-specific survivals, as well as survivals according to the calendar period of diagnosis, increased throughout the observation period. Incidence in younger women (aged 44 and lower) showed linear increases, whereas for women aged 45 and higher mostly stable or decreasing rates were observed. Localised BC incidence increased markedly and started declining only in 2012. Distant disease-BC incidence decreased through the whole observation period and incidence of regionalised BC started declining in 2000. Birth cohort-specific incidence peaked in women born between 1935 and 1949 (ages 45\u201374). In conclusion, the\u00a0incidence of BC in younger women is increasing, while overall female BC incidence and mortality are stable with non-significant declines. Further, increases in the incidence of early-stage BC (localised) seem disproportionately high in comparison to more modest decreases in late-stage BC incidence (regionalised and distant disease)."}

To characterize the intra-patient evolutionary relationships of metastases that evade treatment, we perform genome-wide copy number profiling and bespoke approaches targeting the androgen receptor (AR) on 167 metastatic regions from 11 organs harvested post-mortem from 10 men who died from prostate cancer. We identify diverse and patient-unique alterations clustering around the AR in metastases from every patient with evidence of independent acquisition of related genomic changes within an individual and, in some patients, the co-existence of AR-neutral clones. Using the genomic boundaries of pan-autosome copy number changes, we confirm a common clone of origin across metastases and diagnostic biopsies, and identified in individual patients, clusters of metastases occupied by dominant clones with diverged autosomal copy number alterations. These autosome-defined clusters are characterized by cluster-specific AR gene architectures, and in two index cases are topologically more congruent than by chance (p-values 3.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128\u00a0and 6.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124).

Here, we comprehensively analysed the hypoxia signalling in OS and further constructed novel hypoxia-related gene signatures for OS prediction and prognosis. This study employed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses to identify Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) and Transmembrane Protein 45A (TMEM45A) as the diagnostic biomarkers, which further assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves in training and test dataset. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct the prognostic model. STC2 and metastasis were devised to forge the OS risk model. The nomogram, risk score, Kaplan Meier plot, ROC, DCA, and calibration curves results certified the excellent performance of the prognostic model. The expression level of STC2 and TMEM45A was validated in external datasets and cell lines. In immune cell infiltration analysis, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were significantly higher in the low-risk group. And the immune infiltration of CAFs was negatively associated with the expression of STC2 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pan-cancer analysis revealed that the expression level of STC2 was significantly higher in Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Additionally, the higher expression of STC2 was associated with the poor outcome in those cancers. In summary, this study identified STC2 and TMEM45A as novel markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of osteosarcoma, and STC2 was shown to correlate with immune infiltration of CAFs negatively."}

To define mechanisms involved, here we treat established desmoplastic pancreatic tumors with CAR T cells directed to fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an enzyme highly overexpressed on a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Depletion of FAP+ CAFs results in loss of the structural integrity of desmoplastic matrix. This renders these highly treatment-resistant cancers susceptible to subsequent treatment with a tumor antigen (mesothelin)-targeted CAR T cells and to anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. Mechanisms include overcoming stroma-dependent restriction of T cell extravasation and/or perivascular invasion, reversing immune exclusion, relieving T cell suppression, and altering the immune landscape by reducing myeloid cell accumulation and increasing endogenous CD8+ T cell and NK cell infiltration. These data provide strong rationale for combining tumor stroma- and malignant cell-targeted therapies to be tested in clinical trials."}

In this study, we identified living patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) between July 2007 and January 2022 who would have been eligible for testing, but not tested. Overall, 422 patients met the eligibility criteria, 282 were reached and invited to participate, and germline testing was performed for 238, accounting for 84.4% of those invited. The median age (range) was 39.5 (24\u201364) years at BC diagnosis and 49 (31\u201375) years at the date of testing. Genetic testing revealed that 25 (10.5%) patients had pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants; mostly in BRCA2 and BRCA1. We concluded that long overdue genetic referral through a traceback approach is feasible and effective to diagnose P/LP variants in patients with history of BC who had missed the opportunity of genetic testing, with potential clinical implications for patients and their relatives."}

However, an effective therapy that increases the life expectancy of these patients, with a 5-year overall survival of 50%, is still unknown. Here we evaluated the combined effect of the pro-apoptotic protein rhTRAIL with the replication-competent wild-type HSV-1 virus in head and neck cancer cell lines. We observed a difference in the modulation profile of proteins related to apoptotic pathways in the studied cell lines. The HCB289 exhibited caspase-9 activation in the presence of the HSV-1 virus, while the UD-SCC-2 exhibited caspase-8 activation in the presence of rhTRAIL. Both cell lines exhibited PARP activation by combining rhTRAIL and HSV-1 virus treatment. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited greater induction of late apoptosis for the HCB289 and UD-SCC-2 after the combination treatment of the HSV-1 and rhTRAIL. However, the UD-SCC-2 also presented induction of late apoptosis by the presence of rhTRAIL in monotherapy. These data suggest an enhancement of the effect of the combination treatment of the rhTRAIL and the HSV-1 on reducing viability and induction of cell death."}

The \u201cAtyp.C\u201d parameter of the Sysmex UF-5000 urine particle analyzer represents the ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm and can be employed to detect urinary atypical cells. The present study examined the association between urinary Atyp.C values and BC risk. This two-center, retrospective case\u2013control study identified clinical primary or newly recurrent BC (study period, 2022\u20132023; n\u2009=\u2009473) cases together with controls with urinary tract infection randomly matched by age and sex (1:1). Urinary sediment differences were compared using non-parametric tests. The correlations between urinary Atyp.C levels and BC grade or infiltration were analyzed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation. The BC risk factor odds ratio of Atyp.C was calculated using conditional logistic regression, and potential confounder effects were adjusted using stepwise logistic regression (LR). Primary risk factors were identified by stratified analysis according to pathological histological diagnosis. The mean value of urinary Atyp.C in BC cases (1.30\u2009\u00b1\u20093.12) was 8.7 times higher than that in the controls (0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.68; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Urinary Atyp.C values were positively correlated with BC pathological grade and invasion (r\u2009=\u20090.360, P\u2009<\u20090.001; r\u2009=\u20090.367, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Urinary Atyp.C was an independent risk factor for BC and closely related with BC pathological grade and invasion. Elevated urinary Atyp.C values was an independent risk factor for BC. Our findings support the use of Atyp.C as a marker that will potentially aid in the early diagnosis and long-term surveillance of new and recurrent BC cases."}

A retrospective analysis of 135 TNBC patients (107 responders, 28 non-responders) treated with NAC from January 2015 to October 2022 was conducted. Non-responders were defined according to RECIST guidelines. Data included clinicopathologic factors and clinical MRI findings, with radiomics features from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, to train a stacking ensemble of 13 machine learning models. For subgroup analysis, propensity score matching was conducted to adjust for clinical disparities in NAC response. The efficacy of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) before and after matching. The model combining clinicopathologic factors and clinical MRI findings achieved an AUROC of 0.752 (95% CI 0.644\u20130.860) for predicting non-responders, while radiomics-based models showed 0.749 (95% CI 0.614\u20130.884). An integrated model of radiomics, clinicopathologic factors, and clinical MRI findings reached an AUROC of 0.802 (95% CI 0.699\u20130.905). After propensity score matching, the hierarchical order of key radiomics features remained consistent. Our study demonstrated the potential of using machine learning models based on pretreatment MRI to non-invasively predict TNBC non-responders to NAC."}

However, the limited number of tumor cells, especially from patients with early stage cancer, has hindered the widespread application of this technique. Hence, we developed a digital microfluidic system for drug screening using primary tumor cells and established a working protocol for precision medicine. Smart control logic was developed to increase the throughput of the system and decrease its footprint to parallelly screen three drugs on a 4 \u00d7 4 cm2 chip in a device measuring 23 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 3.5 cm3. We validated this method in an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft mouse model and liver cancer specimens from patients, demonstrating tumor suppression in mice/patients treated with drugs that were screened to be effective on individual primary tumor cells. Mice treated with drugs screened on-chip as ineffective exhibited similar results to those in the control groups. The effective drug identified through on-chip screening demonstrated consistency with the absence of mutations in their related genes determined via exome sequencing of individual tumors, further validating this protocol. Therefore, this technique and system may promote advances in precision medicine for cancer treatment and, eventually, for any disease."}

However, the functionally relevant roles of specific histone deacetylases, in the maintenance of key self-renewal and growth characteristics of brain tumour stem cell (BTSC) sub-populations of glioblastoma, remain to be fully resolved. Here, using pharmacological inhibition and genetic loss and gain of function approaches, we identify HDAC2 as the most relevant histone deacetylase for re-organization of chromatin accessibility resulting in maintenance of BTSC growth and self-renewal properties. Furthermore, its specific interaction with the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 pathway related proteins, SMAD3 and SKI, is crucial for the maintenance of tumorigenic potential in BTSCs in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft models. Inhibition of HDAC2 activity and disruption of the coordinated mechanisms regulated by the HDAC2-SMAD3-SKI axis are thus promising therapeutic approaches for targeting BTSCs."}

And the efficacy of QR-KLU in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody for HCC therapy in vivo and in vitro were evaluated. QR-KLU inhibited the proliferation and migration of mouse HCC cell line (Hepa1\u20136) cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in a dose-dependent manner. In the subcutaneous Hepa1\u20136 tumor model, QR-KLU combined with the anti-PD-1 antibody substantially inhibited tumor growth, promoted tumor necrosis, and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. QR-KLU substantially inhibited hypoxia-induced expression of VEGF, promoted tumor vascular normalization, and increased cluster of differentiation 8+ (CD8+) T cell infiltration in the tumor. In addition, QR-KLU and anti-PD-1 antibody demonstrated a strong synergistic effect in promoting the activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells, reducing the expression of immune-inhibitory factors, and increasing the expression of immune-stimulatory factors. This study proposed a novel approach for enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody using a VEGFR-targeting peptide\u2013drug conjugate in HCC therapy."}

We investigated the prognostic effect of transcriptomic heterogeneity and the potential for classifications less vulnerable to heterogeneity in a single-hospital series of 1093 tumor samples from 692 patients, including multiregional samples from 98 primary tumors and 35 primary-metastasis sets. We show that intra-tumor heterogeneity of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) is frequent and has poor-prognostic associations independently of tumor microenvironment markers. Multiregional transcriptomics uncover cancer cell-intrinsic and low-heterogeneity signals that recapitulate the intrinsic CMSs proposed by single-cell sequencing. Further subclassification identifies congruent CMSs that explain a larger proportion of variation in patient survival than intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plasticity is indicated by discordant intrinsic phenotypes of matched primary and metastatic tumors. We conclude that multiregional sampling reconciles the prognostic power of tumor classifications from single-cell and bulk transcriptomics in the context of intra-tumor heterogeneity, and phenotypic plasticity challenges the reconciliation of primary and metastatic subtypes."}

Here, we show that targeting histone demethylase LSD1 by chemical inhibitors reshapes the epigenome of in vitro activated and expanded CD8+ T cells, and potentiates their antitumor efficacy. Upon T cell receptor activation and IL-2 signaling, a timely and transient inhibition of LSD1 suffices to improve the memory phenotype of mouse CD8+ T cells, associated with a better ability to produce multiple cytokines, resist exhaustion, and persist in both antigen-dependent and -independent manners after adoptive transfer. Consequently, OT1 cells primed with LSD1 inhibitors demonstrate an enhanced antitumor effect in OVA-expressing solid tumor models implanted in female mice, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with PD-1 blockade. Moreover, priming with LSD1 inhibitors promotes polyfunctionality of human CD8+ T cells, and increases the persistence and antitumor efficacy of human CD19-CAR T cells in both leukemia and solid tumor models. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 could be exploited to improve adoptive T cell therapy."}

Markovska", "K. Somers", "J. Guillaume", "J. Melief", "A. P. Mazar", "D. M. Schmitt", "H. S. Schipper", "M. Boes"], "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor, partly due to inadequate immune recognition of the tumor. Neuroblastomas display extremely low surface MHC-I, preventing recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2) is involved in pathways that may affect the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway. We proposed that therapeutic inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 might improve the surface display of MHC-I molecules on neuroblastoma cells, and therefore tested if targeting of GSK-3\u03b2 using the inhibitor 9-ING-41 (Elraglusib) improves MHC-I-mediated CTL recognition. We analyzed mRNA expression data of neuroblastoma tumor datasets and found that non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas express higher GSK-3\u03b2 levels than MYCN-amplified tumors. In non-MYCN-amplified cells SH-SY5Y, SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH 9-ING-41 treatment enhanced MHC-I surface display and the expression levels of a subset of genes involved in MHC-I antigen processing and presentation. Further, 9-ING-41 treatment triggered increased STAT1 pathway activation, upstream of antigen presentation pathways in two of the three non-MYCN-amplified cell lines. Finally, in co-culture experiments with CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells, 9-ING-41 improved immune recognition of the neuroblastoma cells, as evidenced by augmented T-cell activation marker levels and T-cell proliferation, which was further enhanced by PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition. Our preclinical study provides experimental support to further explore the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor 9-ING-41 as an immunomodulatory agent to increase tumor immune recognition in neuroblastoma."}

Here, we used an integrated drug repositioning approach based on transcriptomics data and structure-based virtual screening to identify compounds with gene signatures similar to three known proteasome inhibitors (PIs; bortezomib, MG-132, and MLN-2238). In vitro validation of candidate compounds was then performed to assess proteasomal proteolytic activity, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, cell viability, and drug-induced expression in A375 melanoma and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Using this approach, we identified six compounds with PI properties ((-)-kinetin-riboside, manumycin-A, puromycin dihydrochloride, resistomycin, tegaserod maleate, and thapsigargin). Although the docking scores pinpointed their ability to bind to the \u03b25 subunit, our in vitro study revealed that these compounds inhibited the \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b25 catalytic sites to some extent. As shown with bortezomib, only manumycin-A, puromycin dihydrochloride, and tegaserod maleate resulted in excessive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and elevated HMOX1 expression. Taken together, our integrated drug repositioning approach and subsequent in vitro validation studies identified six compounds demonstrating properties similar to proteasome inhibitors."}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome and clinicopathological parameters of sinonasal AdCC. A retrospective analysis was conducted on all cases of AdCC affecting the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses between 2000 and 2018 at the University Hospital Zurich. Tumor material was examined for morphological features and analyzed for molecular alterations. A total of 14 patients were included. Mean age at presentation was 57.7\u00a0years. Sequencing revealed MYB::NFIB gene fusion in 11/12 analyzable cases. Poor prognostic factors were solid variant (p\u2009<\u20090.001), histopathological high-grade transformation (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and tumor involvement of the sphenoid sinus (p\u2009=\u20090.02). The median recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS were 5.2\u00a0years and 11.3\u00a0years. The RFS rates at 1-, 5-, and 10-year were 100%, 53.8%, and 23.1%. The OS rates at 1-, 5-, and 10- years were 100%, 91.7%, and 62.9%, respectively. In Conclusion, the solid variant (solid portion\u2009>\u200930%), high-grade transformation, and sphenoid sinus involvement are negative prognostic factors for sinonasal AdCC. A high prevalence of MYB::NFIB gene fusion may help to correctly classify diagnostically challenging (e.g. metatypical) cases."}

Here, we phenotyped innate and adaptive cells in human colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer. We found striking differences in \u03b3\u03b4 subsets and function in tumors compared to normal tissue, and in the \u03b3\u03b4 subsets present in tumor types. In CRC, an amphiregulin (AREG)-producing subset emerges, while endometrial cancer is infiltrated by cytotoxic cells. In humanized CRC models, tumors induced this AREG phenotype in V\u03b41 cells after adoptive transfer. To exploit the beneficial roles of \u03b3\u03b4 cells for cell therapy, we developed an expansion method that enhanced cytotoxic function and boosted metabolic flexibility, while eliminating AREG production, achieving greater tumor infiltration and tumor clearance. This method has broad applications in cellular therapy as an \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 treatment option."}

However, the clinical efficacy of SCD1 inhibitor monotherapy is limited. There is thus a need to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to SCD1 inhibition and develop new therapeutic strategies for combination therapy. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent cancer cell death induced by SCD1 inhibition. SCD1 inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells were treated with SCD1 inhibitors in vitro, and SCD1 inhibitor-sensitive cancer cells accumulated palmitic acid and underwent ER stress response-induced cell death. Conversely, SCD1-resistant cancer cells did not undergo ER stress response-induced cell death because fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) eliminated the accumulation of palmitic acid. Furthermore, genetic depletion using siRNA showed that FADS2 is a key determinant of sensitivity/resistance of cancer cells to SCD1 inhibitor. A549 cells, an SCD1 inhibitor-resistant cancer cell line, underwent ER stress-dependent cancer cell death upon dual inhibition of SCD1 and FADS2. Thus, combination therapy with SCD1 inhibition and FADS2 inhibition is potentially a new cancer therapeutic strategy targeting fatty acid metabolism."}

However, the emergence of resistance is inevitable, partly due to the gradual evolution of adaptive resistant cells during initial treatment. Here, we find that Osi treatment rapidly triggers adaptive resistance in tumor cells. Metabolomics analysis reveals a significant enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Osi adaptive-resistant cells. Mechanically, Osi treatment induces an elevation of NCOA4, a key protein of ferritinophagy, which maintains the synthesis of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) proteins of electron transport chain and OXPHOS. Additionally, active ISC protein synthesis in adaptive-resistant cells significantly increases the sensitivity to copper ions. Combining Osi with elesclomol, a copper ion ionophore, significantly increases the efficacy of Osi, with no additional toxicity. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanisms of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in Osi adaptive resistance and introduces a promising new therapy of combining copper ionophores to improve its initial efficacy."}

Targeted sequencing of pre-treatment bone marrow samples from affected patients (n\u2009=\u2009181) revealed 5 highly recurrent patterns of somatic mutation. Using differential expression analyses of the most common genomic subtypes (~60% of total), we identify high expression of multiple potential drivers of inflammation-related treatment resistance. Regardless of genomic subtype, we show that JAK1/2 inhibition reduces receptor-mediated inflammatory signaling by leukemic cells in-vitro. The large number of high-risk pAML genomic subtypes presents an obstacle to the development of mutation-specific therapies. Our findings suggest that therapies targeting inflammatory signaling may be effective across multiple genomic subtypes of pAML."}

Here, we leverage sequencing data from the PanGen trial to perform comprehensive characterization of the molecular landscape of KRAS wildtype mPDAC and reveal increased frequency of chr1q amplification encompassing transcription factors PROX1 and NR5A2. By leveraging data from colorectal adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma samples, we highlight similarities between cholangiocarcinoma and KRAS wildtype mPDAC involving both mutation and expression-based signatures and validate these findings using an independent dataset.

Although melanoma-associated antigen (MAA) -specific TCRs are restricted to individuals, they share sequence similarities that allow us to build classifiers for predicting anti-MAA T cells. The frequency of anti-MAA T cells distinguishes melanoma patients from healthy and predicts metastatic recurrence from primary melanoma. Anti-MAA T cells have stem-like properties and frequent interactions with regulatory T cells and tumor cells via Galectin9-TIM3 and PVR-TIGIT -axes, respectively. In the responding patients, the number of expanded anti-MAA clones are higher after the anti-PD1(+anti-CTLA4) therapy and the exhaustion phenotype is rescued. Our systems immunology approach paves the way for understanding antigen-specific responses in human disorders."}

These changes involve activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and NF\u03baB, and inactivation of NOTCH, while altering responsiveness to chemotherapy and driving infiltrative growth in the brain. Our findings suggest that EV-mediated angiocrine interactions impact the nature of cellular stemness in GBM with implications for disease biology and therapy."}

Beyond the two most common point mutations, which selectively recruit the ETS factor GABP to activate TERT, the significance of other variants is unknown. In seven cancer types, we identify duplications of wildtype sequence within the core promoter region of TERT that have strikingly similar features including an ETS motif, the duplication length and insertion site. The duplications recruit a GABP tetramer by virtue of the native ETS motif and its precisely spaced duplicated counterpart, activate the promoter and are clonal in a TERT expressing multifocal glioblastoma. We conclude that recurrent TERT promoter duplications are functionally and mechanistically equivalent to the hotspot mutations that confer tumor cell immortality. The shared mechanism of these divergent somatic genetic alterations suggests a strong selective pressure for recruitment of the GABP tetramer to activate TERT."}

However, IDO1 inhibitors have shown disappointing therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, mainly because of the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Here, we show a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of IDO1 regulated by a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, USP14, in colorectal cancer (CRC). Overexpression of USP14 promotes tryptophan metabolism and T-cell dysfunction by stabilizing the IDO1 protein. Knockdown of USP14 or pharmacological targeting of USP14 decreases IDO1 expression, reverses suppression of cytotoxic T cells, and increases responsiveness to anti-PD-1 in a MC38 syngeneic mouse model. Importantly, suppression of USP14 has no effects on AhR activation induced by the IDO1 inhibitor. These findings highlight a relevant role of USP14 in post-translational regulation of IDO1 and in the suppression of antitumor immunity, suggesting that inhibition of USP14 may represent a promising strategy for CRC immunotherapy."}

However, the influence of inflammatory conditions on the tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is incompletely understood. Here we show that in a patient with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) CRC and a local inflammatory condition, the primary tumor progresses but its liver metastasis regresses upon Pembrolizumab treatment. In silico investigation prompted by this observation confirms correlation between inflammatory conditions and poor tumor response to PD-1 blockade in MSI-H CRCs, which is further validated in a cohort of 62 patients retrospectively enrolled to our study. Inhibition of local but not systemic immune response is verified in cultures of paired T cells and organoid cells from patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggests involvement of neutrophil leukocytes via CD80/CD86-CTLA4 signaling in the suppressive immune microenvironment. In concordance with this finding, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicates inhibited immune status and poor tumor response to ICIs. Receiver operating characteristic curve further demonstrates that both inflammatory conditions and a high NLR could predict a poor response to ICIs in MSI- CRCs, and the predictive value could be further increased when these two predictors are combined. Our study thus suggests that inflammatory conditions in MSI-H CRCs correlate with resistance to ICIs through neutrophil leukocyte associated immunosuppression and proposes both inflammatory conditions and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as clinical features for poor ICI response."}

ARID1A is an epigenetic regulator mutated in approximately 5% of non-hypermutated CRC tumors. Here we show that anti-EGFR but not anti-VEGF treatment enriches for emerging ARID1A mutations in CRC patients. In addition, we find that patients with ARID1A mutations, at baseline, are associated with worse outcome when treated with cetuximab- but not bevacizumab-containing therapies; thus, this suggests that ARID1A mutations may provide both an acquired and intrinsic mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. We find that, ARID1A and EGFR-pathway genetic alterations are mutually exclusive across lung and colorectal cancers, further supporting a functional connection between these pathways. Our results not only suggest that ARID1A could be potentially used as a predictive biomarker for cetuximab treatment decisions but also provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic MAPK inhibition in an unexpected but genetically defined segment of CRC patients."}

Here, we demonstrate that cell adhesion-related genes are predominantly enriched in DNMT3A-mutant AML cells and identify that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) display an anti-leukemia effect specifically against these mutated cells. Mechanistically, GDYO directly interacts with integrin \u03b22 (ITGB2) and c-type mannose receptor (MRC2), which facilitate the attachment and cellular uptake of GDYO. Furthermore, GDYO binds to actin and prevents actin polymerization, thus disrupting the actin cytoskeleton and eventually leading to cell apoptosis. Finally, we validate the in vivo safety and therapeutic potential of GDYO against DNMT3A-mutant AML cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GDYO is an efficient and specific drug candidate against DNMT3A-mutant AML."}

We digitized 7788 prostate biopsies from 1192 men in the STHLM3 diagnostic study, used for training, and 3059 biopsies from 676 men used for testing. With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on.

The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80%) unreliable predictions.

Here, we demonstrate that growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gamma (GADD45g) is expressed at significantly lower levels in patients with MPNs, and JAK2V617F mutation and histone deacetylation contribute to its reduced expression. Downregulation of GADD45g plays a tumor-promoting role in human MPN cells. Gadd45g insufficiency in the murine hematopoietic system alone leads to significantly enhanced growth and self-renewal capacity of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells, and the development of phenotypes resembling MPNs. Mechanistically, the pathogenic role of GADD45g insufficiency is mediated through a cascade of activations of RAC2, PAK1 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. These data characterize GADD45g deficiency as a novel pathogenic factor in MPNs."}

Compared to erythroblasts from SRSF2- or U2AF1-mutated patients, SF3B1-mutated erythroblasts exhibit augmented DNA synthesis, accelerated replication forks, and single-stranded DNA exposure upon differentiation.

Here, we conduct integrated whole exome and RNA sequencing analysis in 115 DDLPS tumors and perform comparative genomic analysis of well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components from eight DDLPS samples. Several somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs), including the gain of 12q15, are identified as frequent genomic alterations. CTDSP1/2-DNM3OS fusion genes are identified in a subset of DDLPS tumors. Based on the association of SCNAs with clinical features, the DDLPS tumors are clustered into three groups. This clustering can predict the clinical outcome independently. The comparative analysis between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components identify two categories of genomic alterations: shared alterations, associated with tumorigenesis, and dedifferentiated-specific alterations, associated with malignant transformation. This large-scale genomic analysis reveals the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of DDLPS and provides insights that could contribute to the refinement of DDLPS management."}

Pre- and postoperative HU were measured at the vertebral body, pedicle, and spinal cord at three different levels: the lower instrumented vertebra, the level of metastatic spinal cord compression, and an uninvolved level. Areas measured at each level were delicately matched pre- and postoperatively. Significant differences in HU were observed at the vertebral body, the pedicle, and the spinal cord at the lowest instrumented vertebra level for both CF and titanium (average increase 1.54-fold and 5.11-fold respectively). At the metastatic spinal cord compression level, a trend towards a higher HU-increase was observed in titanium compared with CF treated patients (average increase 2.51-fold and 1.43-fold respectively). The relatively high postoperative HU-increase after insertion of titanium implants indicated CT artefacts, while the relatively low HU-increase of CF implants was not associated with artefacts. Less CT artefacts could facilitate an easier contouring phase in radiotherapy planning. In addition, we propose a CT artefact grading system based on postoperative HU-increase. This system could serve as a valuable tool in future research to assess if less CT artefacts lead to time savings during radiotherapy treatment planning and, potentially, to better tumoricidal effects and less adverse effects if particle therapy would be administered."}

Long", "Tibor Keler", "Henry C. Marsh", "Hans Minderman", "Scott I. Abrams", "Song Liu", "Fumito Ito"], "abstract": "The ability of cancer cells to ensure T-cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment is a significant mechanism of resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Evidence indicates crucial roles of Batf3-dependent conventional type-1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) for inducing antitumor T-cell immunity; however, strategies to maximize cDC1 engagement remain elusive. Here, using multiple orthotopic tumor mouse models resistant to anti-PD-L1-therapy, we are testing the hypothesis that in situ induction and activation of tumor-residing cDC1s overcomes poor T-cell infiltration. In situ immunomodulation with Flt3L, radiotherapy, and TLR3/CD40 stimulation induces an influx of stem-like Tcf1+ Slamf6+ CD8+ T cells, triggers regression not only of primary, but also untreated distant tumors, and renders tumors responsive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, serial in situ immunomodulation (ISIM) reshapes repertoires of intratumoral T cells, overcomes acquired resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy, and establishes tumor-specific immunological memory. These findings provide new insights into cDC1 biology as a critical determinant to overcome mechanisms of intratumoral T-cell exclusion."}

Presence of leptomeningeal metastases is indicative of poor prognosis. Here we report that inactivation of Rb plus p53 via a WAP-Cre transgene, commonly used to target the mammary gland during pregnancy, induces metastatic pineoblastoma resembling the human disease with 100% penetrance. A stabilizing mutation rather than deletion of p53 accelerates metastatic dissemination. Deletion of Dicer1 plus p53 via WAP-Cre also predisposes to pineoblastoma, albeit with lower penetrance. In silico analysis predicts tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline as potential therapeutics for both pineoblastoma models. Nortriptyline disrupts the lysosome, leading to accumulation of non-functional autophagosome, cathepsin B release and pineoblastoma cell death. Nortriptyline further synergizes with the antineoplastic drug gemcitabine to effectively suppress pineoblastoma in our preclinical models, offering new modality for this lethal childhood malignancy."}

Hamza", "Slawomir Koziel", "Anna Pietrenko-Dabrowska"], "abstract": "This study proposes an innovative geometry of a microstrip sensor for high-resolution microwave imaging (MWI). The main intended application of the sensor is early detection of breast, lung, and brain cancer. The proposed design consists of a microstrip patch antenna fed by a coplanar waveguide with a metamaterial (MTM) layer-based lens implemented on the back side, and an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) realized on as a separate layer. The analysis of the AMC\u2019s permeability and permittivity demonstrate that the structure exhibits negative epsilon (ENG) qualities near the antenna resonance point. In addition, reflectivity, transmittance, and absorption are also studied. The sensor prototype has been manufactures using the FR4 laminate. Excellent electrical and field characteristics of the structure are confirmed through experimental validation. At the resonance frequency of 4.56\u00a0GHz, the realized gain reaches 8.5 dBi, with 3.8 dBi gain enhancement contributed by the AMC. The suitability of the presented sensor for detecting brain tumors, lung cancer, and breast cancer has been corroborated through extensive simulation-based experiments performed using the MWI system model, which employs four copies of the proposed sensor, as well as the breast, lung, and brain phantoms. As demonstrated, the directional radiation pattern and enhanced gain of the sensor enable precise tumor size discrimination. The proposed sensor offers competitive performance in comparison the state-of-the-art sensors described in the recent literature, especially with respect to as gain, pattern directivity, and impedance matching, all being critical for MWI."}

MIM Software (MIM 7.0.7; MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) was used to register adjacent phase CT images in the 4D-CT series. The three-dimensional displacement vector of CT pixels was obtained when changing from one respiratory state to another respiratory state, and this three-dimensional vector was quantitatively analyzed. Thus, a color schematic diagram reflecting the degree of changes in lung CT pixels during the breathing process, namely the distribution of ventilation function strength, is obtained. Finally, this diagram is fused with the localization CT image. Select areas with Jacobi\u2009>\u20091.2 as high lung function areas and outline them as fLung. Import the patient's DVH image again, fuse the lung ventilation image with the localization CT image, and obtain the volume of fLung different doses (V60, V55, V50, V45, V40, V35, V30, V25, V20, V15, V10, V5). Analyze the functional dose volume parameters related to the risk of level 2 and above radiation pneumonia using R language and create a predictive model. By using stepwise regression and optimal subset method to screen for independent variables V35, V30, V25, V20, V15, and V10, the prediction formula was obtained as follows: Risk\u2009=\u20090.23656\u20130.13784 * V35\u2009+\u20090.37445 * V30-0.38317 * V25\u2009+\u20090.21341 * V20-0.10209 * V15\u2009+\u20090.03815 * V10. These six independent variables were analyzed using a column chart, and a calibration curve was drawn using the calibrate function. It was found that the Bias corrected line and the Apparent line were very close to the Ideal line, The consistency between the predicted value and the actual value is very good. By using the ROC function to plot the ROC curve and calculating the area under the curve: 0.8475, 95% CI 0.7237\u20130.9713, it can also be determined that the accuracy of the model is very high. In addition, we also used Lasso method and random forest method to filter out independent variables with different results, but the calibration curve drawn by the calibration function confirmed poor prediction performance. The function dose volume parameters V35, V30, V25, V20, V15, and V10 obtained through 4D-CT are key factors affecting radiation pneumonia. Establishing a predictive model can provide more accurate lung restriction basis for clinical radiotherapy planning."}

A total of 36 PSP patients with multiple tumor characteristics were identified from the literature search. They were compared with 43 solitary PSP patients diagnosed and treated in our hospital in the past 5\u00a0years. Thus, the pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnosis methods, treatment strategies, and prognosis of pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (PSP) patients with multiple tumors were explored. Patients with multiple PSP are mostly distributed in Asia (88.89%) and are females (83.33%). PSP can be located in any one lobe (19.44%), or grow across ipsilateral lobes (44.44%), or even, bilateral lobes (36.11%). It can be accompanied by metastasis (9.09%) and is prone to misdiagnosis (27.78%). Compared with solitary PSP, the occurrence age of multiple PSP was younger (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation [SD]: 40.36\u2009\u00b1\u200918.12: 51.28\u2009\u00b1\u200912.74\u00a0years), but there was no significant difference in sex, tumor size (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 43.54\u2009\u00b1\u200946.18: 30.56\u2009\u00b1\u200917.62\u00a0mm), or symptoms. Individualized surgical resection is required for treatment, including pneumonectomy (17.65%), lobectomy (23.53%), subpulmonary lobectomy (38.24%), or combined lobectomy (5.88%). Multiple PSP is relatively rare. Surgical resection within a limited time should be the main treatment for such patients. The prognosis of patients with multiple PSP is generally good, but inappropriate diagnosis and treatment plans may lead to poor prognosis."}

Clear margin resection is challenging because of microscopic infiltration. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the overall and disease-free survival rates of patients with myxofibrosarcoma and the prognostic factors that determine both survival and disease recurrence. Among the 111 patients included in our study, the 5-year overall survival rate was 65.5%. An age of more than 65\u00a0years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4\u20135.6]; p\u2009<\u20090.001), a tumor size of more than 5\u00a0cm (HR 2.8 [95% CI 0.9\u20138.1]; p\u2009=\u20090.049) and the G3 tumor grade (HR 14.1 [95% CI 2.1\u2013105.0]; p\u2009<\u20090.001) negatively affected overall survival. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 49.4%. R1/R2-type resection (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.0\u20135.6]; p\u2009=\u20090.048) had a detrimental effect on tumor recurrence. Clear margins had a positive impact on recurrence-free survival, but did not significantly affect overall patient survival, suggesting that other factors may play a more significant role in determining patient outcomes. A surgical margin of 2\u00a0mm was not sufficient to significantly influence the incidence of recurrence. Consequently, a wider surgical margin may be necessary to reduce the risk of myxofibrosarcoma recurrence."}

The study retrospectively included 137 elderly patients with LS-SCLC who previously received radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors and determine optimal cut-off values. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves and nomograms were constructed to predict survival. Calibration and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the nomogram. Illness rating scale-geriatric (CIRS-G) score, treatment strategy, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), white blood cell-to-monocyte ratio (WMR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were discovered to be independent prognostic factors. Based on the findings of our multivariate analysis, a risk nomogram was developed to assess patient prognosis. Internal bootstrap resampling was utilized to validate the model, and while the accuracy of the AUC curve at 1\u00a0year was modest at 0.657 (95% CI 0.458\u20130.856), good results were achieved in predicting 3- and 5\u00a0year survival with AUCs of 0.757 (95% CI 0.670\u20130.843) and 0.768 (95% CI 0.643\u20130.893), respectively. Calibration curves for 1-, 3-, and 5\u00a0year overall survival probabilities demonstrated good cocsistency between expected and actual outcomes. Patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, CIRS-G score\u2009>\u20095 points and low PNI, WMR and LMR correlated with poor prognosis. The nomogram model developed based on these factors demonstrated good predictive performance and provides a simple, accessible, and practical tool for clinicians to guide clinical decision-making and study design."}

Beach", "Guilherme Harada", "Alexander Drilon", "Monika A.

We investigated the activity of various TKIs against wildtype and mutant ROS1, focusing on the emerging L2086F resistance mutation. Using Ba/F3 and NIH3T3 cell models, CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic wildtype and mutant patient-derived cell lines, and in vivo tumor growth studies, we compared type I TKIs (crizotinib, entrectinib, taletrectinib, lorlatinib, and repotrectinib) to type II TKIs (cabozantinib and merestinib) and the type I FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib. The ROS1 L2086F mutant kinase showed resistance to type I TKIs, while type II TKIs retained activity. Gilteritinib inhibited both wildtype and L2086F mutant ROS1 but was ineffective against the G2032R mutation. Structural analyses revealed distinct binding poses for cabozantinib and gilteritinib, explaining their efficacy against L2086F. Clinical cases demonstrated cabozantinib\u2019s effectiveness in patients with TKI-resistant, ROS1 L2086F mutant NSCLCs. This study provides the first comprehensive report of ROS1 L2086F in the context of later-generation TKIs, including macrocyclic inhibitors. While cabozantinib effectively inhibits ROS1 L2086F, its multi-kinase inhibitor nature highlights the need for more selective and better-tolerated TKIs to overcome kinase-intrinsic resistance. Gilteritinib may offer an alternative for targeting ROS1 L2086F with distinct off-target toxicities, but further studies are required to fully evaluate its potential in this setting."}

This study proposes a novel method for acquiring, registering, and fusing three-dimensional (3D) trans-abdominal and 3D trans-rectal ultrasound (US) images for visualization of the pelvic anatomy and applicators during gynecologic brachytherapy. The workflow was validated using custom multi-modal pelvic phantoms and demonstrated during two patient procedures. Experiments were performed for three types of intracavitary applicators: ring-and-tandem, ring-and-tandem with interstitial needles, and tandem-and-ovoids. Fused 3D US images were registered to magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images for validation. The target registration error (TRE) and fiducial localization error (FLE) were calculated to quantify the accuracy of our fusion technique. For both phantom and patient images, TRE and FLE across all modality registrations (3D US versus MR or CT) resulted in mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of 4.01\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01\u00a0mm and 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24\u00a0mm, respectively.

The primary endpoints were to assess the most effective combination of vaccine and adjuvant in order to enhance the immune potency, along with safety. The combination of ATL-DC vaccination and TLR agonist was safe and found to enhance systemic immune responses, as indicated by increased interferon gene expression and changes in immune cell activation. Specifically, PD-1 expression increases on CD4+\u2009T-cells, while CD38 and CD39 expression are reduced on CD8+\u2009T cells, alongside an increase in monocytes. Poly-ICLC treatment amplifies the induction of interferon-induced genes in monocytes and T lymphocytes. Patients that exhibit higher interferon response gene expression demonstrate prolonged survival and delayed disease progression. These findings suggest that combining ATL-DC with poly-ICLC can induce a polarized interferon response in circulating monocytes and CD8+\u2009T cells, which may represent an important blood biomarker for immunotherapy in this patient population.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01204684."}

Recently, structure\u2013activity relationship analysis reported by our group suggested that selective cytotoxicity of fascaplysin derivatives towards tumor cells negatively correlates with their ability to intercalate into DNA. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized 6- and 7-tert-butylfascaplysins which reveal mitigated DNA-intercalating properties. These derivatives were found to be strongly cytotoxic to drug-resistant human prostate cancer cells, albeit did not demonstrate improved selectivity towards cancer cells when compared to fascaplysin. At the same time, kinome analysis suggested an activation of CHK1/ATR axis in cancer cells shortly after the drug exposure. Further experiments revealed induction of replication stress that is eventually converted to the toxic DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death. Our observations highlight new DNA-targeting effect of some fascaplysin derivatives and indicate more complex structure\u2013activity relationships within the fascaplysin family, suggesting that cytotoxicity and selectivity of these alkaloids are influenced by multiple factors. Furthermore, combination with clinically-approved inhibitors of ATR/CHK1 as well as testing in tumors particularly sensitive to the DNA damage should be considered in further studies."}

Clinical and follow-up data of 126 male patients with NFPAs treated by transnasal sphenoidal surgery from January 2011 to January 2021 in Fuzhou 900th Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Lasso regression analysis was used to screen the best predictors, and the predictors were further screened by multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the nomogram prediction model was constructed. The performance of the model was verified by three aspects: discrimination, calibration and clinical utility by using the consistency index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration curve, clinical decision curve (DCA) and Clinical impact curve (CIC).  Out of 126 cases, 7 (5.56%) showed postoperative tumor recurrence, and 18 (14.29%) exhibited postoperative residual regrowth (progression).

Women of low socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. Women living in low-and middle-income countries often encounter resistance from their partners regarding participation in cervical cancer screening.

Men\u2019s awareness, knowledge, and perceptions of cervical cancer screening were low. On the other hand, men have a positive attitude towards screening and encourage their wives to get screened if they notice symptoms of cervical cancer. This survey will serve as a basis for the development of further strategies and action plans to promote and support male participation in cervical cancer screening in Ethiopia. This can be achieved through the development of strategic plans, including public campaigns, raising awareness among social and community leaders, involving non-governmental organizations focusing on women's health, and community education."}

Little is known regarding whether these immunomodulatory bacteria also affect antitumour immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Here we show that administration of P. anaerobius abolished the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in mouse models of CRC. P. anaerobius both induced intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and stimulated their immunosuppressive activities to impair effective T cell responses. Mechanistically, P. anaerobius administration activated integrin \u03b12\u03b21\u2013NF-\u03baB signalling in CRC cells to induce secretion of CXCL1 and recruit CXCR2+ MDSCs into tumours. The bacterium also directly activated immunosuppressive activity of intratumoral MDSCs by secreting lytC_22, a protein that bound to the Slamf4 receptor on MDSCs and promoted ARG1 and iNOS expression. Finally, therapeutic targeting of either integrin \u03b12\u03b21 or the Slamf4 receptor were revealed as promising strategies to overcome P. anaerobius-mediated resistance to anti-PD1 therapy in CRC."}

We show here that depletion of the PIAS2 beta isoform with a transcribed double-stranded RNA\u2013directed RNA interference (PIAS2b-dsRNAi) specifically inhibits growth of ATC cell lines and patient primary cultures in vitro and of orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (oPDX) in vivo. Critically, PIAS2b-dsRNAi does not affect growth of normal or non-anaplastic thyroid tumor cultures (differentiated carcinoma, benign lesions) or cell lines. PIAS2b-dsRNAi also has an anti-cancer effect on other anaplastic human cancers (pancreas, lung, and gastric). Mechanistically, PIAS2b is required for proper mitotic spindle and centrosome assembly, and it is a dosage-sensitive protein in ATC. PIAS2b depletion promotes mitotic catastrophe at prophase. High-throughput proteomics reveals the proteasome (PSMC5) and spindle cytoskeleton (TUBB3) to be direct targets of PIAS2b SUMOylation at mitotic initiation. These results identify PIAS2b-dsRNAi as a promising therapy for ATC and other aggressive anaplastic carcinomas."}

We define a myriad of cell states constituting the tumor-normal ecosystems and also identify hallmark gene signatures across different cell types and organs. Our atlas characterizes distinctions between inflammatory fibroblasts marked by AKR1C1 or WNT5A in terms of cellular interactions and spatial co-localization patterns. Co-occurrence analysis reveals interferon-enriched community states including tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) components, which exhibit differential rewiring between tumor, adjacent normal, and healthy normal tissues. The favorable response of interferon-enriched community states to immunotherapy is validated using immunotherapy-treated cancers (n\u2009=\u20091261) including our lung cancer cohort (n\u2009=\u2009497). Deconvolution of spatial transcriptomes discriminates TLS-enriched from non-enriched cell types among immunotherapy-favorable components.

Various approaches for generating tumor labels to train a tumor segmentation model was explored. A large dataset of low-cost low-accuracy panCK-based annotations was used to pre-train the model and determine the minimum required size of the\u00a0expensive but highly accurate pathologist annotations dataset. PanCK pre-training was compared to foundation models and various architectures were explored for model backbone. Proper study design and sample procurement for training a generalizable model that captured variations in NSCLC H&E was studied. H&E imaging was performed on 112 samples (three centers, two scanner types, different staining and imaging protocols). Attention U-Net architecture was trained using the large panCK-based annotations dataset (68 samples, total area 10,326 [mm2]) followed by fine-tuning using a small pathologist annotations dataset (80 samples, total area 246 [mm2]). This approach resulted in mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 82% [77 87]. Using panCK pretraining provided better performance compared to foundation models and allowed for 70% reduction in pathologist annotations with no drop in performance. Study design ensured model generalizability over variations on H&E where performance was consistent across centers, scanners, and subtypes."}

Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioma. We show that microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while tumor cells principally express CD73. In glioblastoma, CD73 is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine, and is linked to hypoxia. Glioblastomas enriched for CD73 exhibit inflammatory microenvironments, suggesting that purinergic signaling regulates immune adaptation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate a strong spatial correlation between tumor-CD73 and microglial-CD39, with proximity associated with poor outcomes. Similar spatial organization is present in pediatric high-grade gliomas including H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. These data reveal that purinergic signaling in gliomas is shaped by genotype, lineage, and functional state, and that core enzymes expressed by tumor and myeloid cells are organized to promote adenosine-rich microenvironments potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting."}

Although the applicability of outcomes from this trial to all cancer types and the optimal thresholds for TMB are yet to be ascertained, research into TMB is advancing along three principal avenues: enhancement of TMB assessments through rigorous quality control measures within the laboratory process, including the mitigation of confounding factors such as limited panel scope and low tumour purity; refinement of the traditional TMB framework through the incorporation of innovative concepts such as clonal, persistent\u00a0or HLA-corrected TMB, tumour neoantigen load and mutational signatures; and integration of TMB with established and emerging biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability, immune gene expression profiles and the tumour immune contexture. Given its pivotal functions in both the pathogenesis of cancer and the ability of the immune system to recognize tumours, a profound comprehension of the foundational principles and the continued evolution of TMB are of paramount relevance for the field of oncology."}

Croul", "Ichiro Nakano", "Yasser Riazalhosseini", "Janusz Rak"], "abstract": "Targeting neovascularization in glioblastoma (GBM) is hampered by poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms and unclear linkages to tumour molecular landscapes. Here we report that different molecular subtypes of human glioma stem cells (GSC) trigger distinct endothelial responses involving either angiogenic or circumferential vascular growth (vasectasia). The latter process is selectively triggered by mesenchymal (but not proneural) GSCs and is mediated by a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) able to transfer EGFR/EGFRvIII transcript to endothelial cells. Inhibition of the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR in endothelial cells, either pharmacologically (Dacomitinib) or genetically (gene editing), abolishes their EV responses in vitro and disrupts vasectasia in vivo. Therapeutic inhibition of EGFR markedly extends anticancer effects of VEGF blockade in mice, coupled with abrogation of vasectasia and prolonged survival. Thus, vasectasia driven by intercellular transfer of oncogenic EGFR may represent a new therapeutic target in a subset of GBMs."}

Here, we propose the use of DNA methylation, as an emerging clinical diagnostic platform, to classify gliomas based on major genomic alterations and provide insight into subtype characteristics. We show that using machine learning models, DNA methylation signatures can accurately predict somatic alterations and show improvement over existing classifiers. The established Unified Diagnostic Pipeline (UniD) we develop is rapid and cost-effective for genomic alterations and gene expression subtypes diagnostic at early clinical phase and improves over individual assays currently in clinical use. The significant relationship between genetic alteration and epigenetic signature indicates broad applicability of our approach to other malignancies."}

Our multi-omics clustering followed by single-sample and single-cell inference of hematopoietic differentiation establishes five robust integrative clusters (ICs) with different master transcription factors, fusion partners and corresponding stages of B-lymphopoietic and early hemato-endothelial development: IRX-type differentiated (IC1), IRX-type undifferentiated (IC2), HOXA-type MLLT1 (IC3), HOXA-type MLLT3 (IC4), and HOXA-type AFF1 (IC5).

Here we create a ROS-responsive hydrogel to realize the sustained co-delivery of photosensitizers and ICB antibodies. During PDT, the hydrogel skeleton poly(deca-4,6-diynedioic acid) (PDDA) protects ICB antibodies by scavenging the harmful ROS, and at the same time, triggers the gradual degradation of the hydrogel to release the drugs in a controlled manner. More interestingly, we can visualize the ROS-responsive hydrogel degradation by Raman imaging, given the ultrastrong and degradation-correlative Raman signal of PDDA in the cellular silent window. A single administration of the hydrogel not only completely inhibits the long-term postoperative recurrence and metastasis of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice, but also effectively restrains the growth of re-challenged tumors. The PDDA-based ROS-responsive hydrogel herein paves a promising way for\u00a0the durable synergy of PDT and ICB therapy."}

Here, we show that Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PSCK9) promotes APC/KRAS-mutant CRC and is a therapeutic target. Using CRC patient cohorts, isogenic cell lines and transgenic mice, we identify that de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is induced in APC/KRAS mutant CRC, accompanied by increased geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)\u2500a metabolite necessary for KRAS activation. PCSK9 is the top up-regulated cholesterol-related gene. PCSK9 depletion represses APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cell growth in vitro and in vivo, whereas PCSK9 overexpression induces oncogenesis. Mechanistically, PCSK9 reduces cholesterol uptake but induces cholesterol de novo biosynthesis and GGPP accumulation. GGPP is a pivotal metabolite downstream of PCSK9 by activating KRAS/MEK/ERK signaling. PCSK9 inhibitors suppress growth of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cells, organoids and xenografts, especially in combination with simvastatin. PCSK9 overexpression predicts poor survival of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC patients. Together, cholesterol homeostasis regulator PCSK9 promotes APC/KRAS-mutant CRC via GGPP-KRAS/MEK/ERK axis and is a therapeutic target."}

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive desmoplasia with fibroblasts as the major cell type. In the present study, we observe enrichment of myofibroblasts in a juxta-tumoral position with tumor cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that facilitates invasion and correlates with a worse clinical prognosis in PDAC patients. Direct cell-cell contacts forming heterocellular aggregates between fibroblasts and tumor cells are detected in primary pancreatic tumors and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM). Mechanistically, ATP1A1 overexpressed in tumor cells binds to and reorganizes ATP1A1 of fibroblasts that induces calcium oscillations, NF-\u03baB activation, and activin A secretion. Silencing ATP1A1 expression or neutralizing activin A secretion suppress tumor invasion and colonization. Taken together, these results elucidate the direct interplay between tumor cells and bound fibroblasts in PDAC progression, thereby providing potential therapeutic opportunities for inhibiting metastasis by interfering with these cell-cell interactions."}

In this nationwide cohort study, we assessed the association between medication use at breast cancer diagnosis and survival. We included 235,368 French women with newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer. In analyzes of 288 medications, we identified eight medications positively associated with either overall survival or disease-free survival: rabeprazole, alverine, atenolol, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, estriol (vaginal or transmucosal), nomegestrol, and hypromellose; and eight medications negatively associated with overall survival or disease-free survival: ferrous fumarate, prednisolone, carbimazole, pristinamycin, oxazepam, alprazolam, hydroxyzine, and mianserin. Full results are available online from an interactive platform (https://adrenaline.curie.fr). This resource provides hypotheses for drugs that may naturally influence breast cancer evolution."}

Here, we perform spatial-longitudinal whole-exome sequencing, including 140 samples collected from 24 Multiple Myeloma patients during up to 14 years. Applying imaging-guided sampling we observe three evolutionary patterns, including relapse driven by a single-cell expansion, competing/co-existing sub-clones, and unique sub-clones at distinct locations. While we do not find the unique relapse sub-clone in the baseline focal lesion(s), we show a close phylogenetic relationship between baseline focal lesions and relapse disease, highlighting focal lesions as hotspots of tumor evolution. In patients with \u22653 focal lesions on positron-emission-tomography at diagnosis, relapse is driven by multiple distinct sub-clones, whereas in other patients, a single-cell expansion is typically seen (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Notably, we observe resistant sub-clones that can be hidden over years, suggesting that a prerequisite for curative therapies would be to overcome not only tumor heterogeneity but also dormancy."}

The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to estimate time-to-event distributions. Cox proportional hazard methods were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and tests for significance for event times. 561 patients were enrolled in cohort 1 and 104 in cohort 2. After central pathology review, 26% in cohort 1 were recategorized as high-grade and 26% in cohort 2 as low- or intermediate-grade. Mean DCIS size was similar at 7.5\u2009mm in cohort 1 and 7.8\u2009mm in cohort 2. Surgical margin was \u22653\u2009mm in 96% of patients, and about 30% received tamoxifen.

Within our study, we evaluated the predictive value of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) clusters in primary MM and its association to molecular subtypes to predict response to CPI treatment. A cohort of 90 MM patients who received CPI treatment were collected from a single center, as well as a validation cohort of 351 patients from the TCGA database (SKCM) who received standard of care. A deep-convolutional-neural network (U-Net) was trained to detect viable tumor areas on H&E whole-slide-images, following a quantitative detection of TILs with help of a separate additional neural network. The number of TIL clusters was associated with response to CPI in 90 MM patients (AUC\u2009=\u20090.6), even more pronounced\u00a0within the sub-cohort of BRAF V600E/K-mutated MM patients (AUC\u2009=\u20090.7, n\u2009=\u200932).

Moreover, PD-L1 expression had a limited predictive value within our cohort. In parallel, within an independent cohort of MM patients (TCGA, n\u2009=\u2009351), the number of TIL clusters was associated with improved survival in BRAF V600E/K mutated MM (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, n\u2009=\u2009164) but neither in NRAS-mutated (55.7\u00a0months vs. 63.0\u00a0months, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.590, n\u2009=\u200985) nor BRAF/NRAS-wildtype MM patients (52.4\u00a0months vs. 47.4\u00a0months, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.581, n\u2009=\u2009104).

US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data from 1980 to 2016 were examined to assess the relationship between prostate cancer mortality and cumulative excess incidence (CEI) in the PSA screening era and to clarify the impact of race on this relationship. CEI was considered as a surrogate for the intensity of prostate cancer screening with PSA testing and subsequent biopsy as appropriate. Data from 163,982,733 person-years diagnosed with 544,058 prostate cancers (9 registries, 9% of US population) were examined. Strong inverse linear relationships were noted between CEI and prostate cancer mortality, and 317,356 prostate cancer deaths were avoided. Eight regions of the US demonstrated prostate cancer mortality reduction of 46.0\u201363.7%. On a per population basis, the lives of more black men than white men were saved in three of four registries with sufficient black populations for comparison. Factor(s) independent of CEI (potential effects of treatment advances) explained 14.6% of the mortality benefit (p-value\u2009=\u20090.3357) while there was a significant main effect of CEI (effect\u2009=\u2009\u22120.0064; CI: [\u22120.0088, \u22120.0040]; p-value\u2009<\u20090.0001). Therefore, there is a strong relationship between CEI and prostate cancer mortality reduction that was not related to factors independent of screening utilization. Minority populations have experienced large mortality reductions in the context of PSA mass utilization."}

The present study was designed to explore the prognostic role of the LANR in NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy and to construct a nomogram for predicting patient survival. This study retrospectively reviewed 805 NPC patients (604 in the training cohort and 201 in the validation cohort) who received definitive radiotherapy between January 2013 and December 2019. The clinical data and pretreatment laboratory test data, including lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and serum ALB concentration, were collected for all patients. The LANR was calculated as the albumin \u00d7 lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. Patients in the training cohort and validation cohort were categorized into high-LANR and low-LANR groups according to the corresponding cutoff values. The independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and a nomogram was subsequently constructed. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. A low LANR (<\u200914.3) was independently associated with worse OS, PFS and MFS in NPC patients. A prognostic prediction nomogram was established based on T stage, N stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, treatment modality, and LANR and was validated. The C-indices of the nomograms for OS and PFS in the training cohort were 0.729 and 0.72, respectively. The C-indices of the nomograms for OS and PFS in the validation cohort were 0.694 and 0.695, respectively. The calibration curve revealed good consistency between the actual survival and the nomogram prediction. Patients with NPC with low pretreatment LANR had a poor prognosis. The nomogram established on the basis of the LANR was efficient and clinically useful for predicting survival in NPC patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy."}

By contrast, the frequency and roles of mutations in the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome are poorly understood. Here we sequence the mitochondrial genomes of 384 localized prostate cancer patients, and identify a median of one mitochondrial single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) per patient. Some of these mtSNVs occur in recurrent mutational hotspots and associate with aggressive disease. Younger patients have fewer mtSNVs than those who diagnosed at an older age. We demonstrate strong links between mitochondrial and nuclear mutational profiles, with co-occurrence between specific mutations. For example, certain control region mtSNVs co-occur with gain of the MYC oncogene, and these mutations are jointly associated with patient survival. These data demonstrate frequent mitochondrial mutation in prostate cancer, and suggest interplay between nuclear and mitochondrial mutational profiles in prostate cancer."}

Here we show that monoallelic loss of ARID1A in the mouse endometrial epithelium is sufficient for vaginal bleeding when combined with PI3K activation. Sorted mutant epithelial cells display gene expression and promoter chromatin signatures associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We further show that ARID1A is bound to promoters with open chromatin, but ARID1A loss leads to increased promoter chromatin accessibility and the expression of EMT genes. PI3K activation partially rescues the mesenchymal phenotypes driven by ARID1A loss through antagonism of ARID1A target gene expression, resulting in partial EMT and invasion. We propose that ARID1A normally maintains endometrial epithelial cell identity by repressing mesenchymal cell fates, and that coexistent ARID1A and PI3K mutations promote epithelial transdifferentiation and collective invasion. Broadly, our findings support a role for collective epithelial invasion in the spread of abnormal endometrial tissue."}

Despite being histologically low-grade, chordoid gliomas are often associated with poor outcome, as their stereotypic location in the third ventricle makes resection challenging and efficacious adjuvant therapies have not been developed. Here we performed genomic profiling on 13 chordoid gliomas and identified a recurrent D463H missense mutation in PRKCA in all tumors, which localizes in the kinase domain of the encoded protein kinase C alpha (PKC\u03b1). Expression of mutant PRKCA in immortalized human astrocytes led to increased phospho-ERK and anchorage-independent growth that could be blocked by MEK inhibition.

{"title": "Aspartame carcinogenic potential revealed through network toxicology and molecular docking insights", "published": "20 May 2024", "authors": ["Dandan Chen", "Xianbing Hou"], "abstract": "The research employed network toxicology and molecular docking techniques to systematically examine the potential carcinogenic effects and mechanisms of aspartame (l-\u03b1-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester). Aspartame, a commonly used synthetic sweetener, is widely applied in foods and beverages globally. In recent years, its safety issues, particularly the potential carcinogenic risk, have garnered widespread attention. The study first constructed an interaction network map of aspartame with gastric cancer targets using network toxicology methods and identified key targets and pathways. Preliminary validation was conducted through microarray data analysis and survival analysis, and molecular docking techniques were employed to further examine the binding affinity and modes of action of aspartame with key proteins. The findings suggest that aspartame has the potential to impact various cancer-related proteins, potentially raising the likelihood of cellular carcinogenesis by interfering with biomolecular function. Furthermore, the study found that the action patterns and pathways of aspartame-related targets are like the mechanisms of known carcinogenic pathways, further supporting the scientific hypothesis of its potential carcinogenicity. However, given the complexity of the in vivo environment, we also emphasize the necessity of validating these molecular-level findings in actual biological systems. The study introduces a fresh scientific method for evaluating the safety of food enhancers and provides a theoretical foundation for shaping public health regulations."}

We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for POD and to construct a predictive nomogram. Data for a total of 1481 older patients (training set: n=1109; validation set: n=372) who received liver resection for HCC were retrospectively retrieved from two prospective databases. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance. The rate of POD was 13.3% (148/1109) in the training set and 16.4% (61/372) in the validation set. Multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that factors including age, history of cerebrovascular disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, albumin level, and surgical approach had significant effects on POD.

DCA demonstrated that the newly established nomogram was highly effective for clinical decision-making. We developed and validated a nomogram with high sensitivity to assist clinicians in estimating the individual risk of POD in older patients with HCC."}

However, previous studies have not systematically analyzed the association between MMP and prostate cancer, so we conducted systematic data collection and analyzed to evaluate the relationship among polymorphisms in MMPs and PCa susceptibility. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar for all papers published up to Apr 3rd, 2023, and systematically analyzed the relationship among MMP1-1607 2G/1G, MMP2-1306\u00a0T/C, MMP2-735\u00a0T/C, MMP7-181 G/A, MMP9-1562\u00a0T/C and PCa susceptibility using multiple comparative models and subgroup analyses. We found that MMP2-1306\u00a0T/C polymorphism showed associations with PCa susceptibility, with the Ethnicity subgroup (Asian) being more pronounced. Similarly, MMP9-1562\u00a0T/C has also had associations with PCa susceptibility. Our current study found that the polymorphisms of, MMP2-1306\u00a0T/C, and MMP9-1562\u00a0T/C had strong associations with PCa risk."}

Cells deficient in either ATPase have been shown to depend on the remaining counterpart for survival. Contrary to this paralog synthetic lethality, concomitant loss of SMARCA4/2 occurs in a subset of cancers associated with very poor outcomes. Here, we uncover that SMARCA4/2-loss represses expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, causing reduced glucose uptake and glycolysis accompanied with increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); adapting to this, these SMARCA4/2-deficient cells rely on elevated SLC38A2, an amino acid transporter, to increase glutamine import for fueling OXPHOS. Consequently, SMARCA4/2-deficient cells and tumors are highly sensitive to inhibitors targeting OXPHOS or glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation of alanine, also imported by SLC38A2, restricts glutamine uptake through competition and selectively induces death in SMARCA4/2-deficient cancer cells. At a clinically relevant dose, alanine supplementation synergizes with OXPHOS inhibition or conventional chemotherapy eliciting marked antitumor activity in patient-derived xenografts. Our findings reveal multiple druggable vulnerabilities of SMARCA4/2-loss exploiting a GLUT1/SLC38A2-mediated metabolic shift. Particularly, unlike dietary deprivation approaches, alanine supplementation can be readily applied to current regimens for better treatment of these aggressive cancers."}

By comprehensively analyzing the cell line\u2019s phenotype, molecular characteristics, biomarkers, and histological characteristics, we confirmed that GBC-X1 serves as a valuable model for investigating the pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer and developing therapeutic agents. GBC-X1 has been continuously cultured for one year, with over 60 stable passages. Morphologically, GBC-X1 exhibits typical features of epithelial tumors. The population doubling time of GBC-X1 is 32\u00a0h. STR analysis validated a high consistency between GBC-X1 and the patient\u2019s primary tumor. Karyotype analysis revealed an abnormal hypertetraploid karyotype for GBC-X1, characterized by representative karyotypes of 98, XXXX del (4) p (12) del (5) p (21) der (10). Under suspension culture conditions, GBC-X1 efficiently forms tumor balls, while subcutaneous inoculation of GBC-X1 cells into NXG mice leads to xenograft formation with a rate of 80%. Drug sensitivity testing demonstrated that GBC-X1 is resistant to oxaliplatin and sensitive to 5-FU, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel. Immunohistochemistry revealed positive expression of CK7, CK19, E-cadherin, MMP-2, CD44, SOX2, and TP53 in GBC-X1 cells, weak positive expression of Vimentin, and a Ki67 positive rate of 35%. Our research highlights GBC-X1 as a novel gallbladder cancer cell line and emphasizes its potential as an effective experimental model for investigating the pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer and drug development."}

We analyzed data from the FAERS database (January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2023) using disproportionality and Bayesian methods. We identified 3076 cases of ADC-associated peripheral neuropathy. Our study revealed significant signals for all ADCs (ROR 1.82, 95% CI 1.76\u20131.89). ADCs with tubulin-binding payloads showed significant peripheral neuropathy signals (ROR 2.31, 95% CI 2.23\u20132.40), whereas those with DNA-targeting (ROR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39\u20130.59) and topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (ROR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48\u20130.66) payloads exhibited non-significant signals. Signals for peripheral sensory neuropathy were 4.83, 2.44, 2.74, and 2.21 (calculated based on IC025) for brentuximab vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, enfortumab vedotin, and polatuzumab vedotin, while signals for peripheral motor neuropathy were 5.31, 0.34, 2.27, and 0.03, respectively. The median time to onset for all ADCs was 127\u00a0days (interquartile range 40\u2013457). Tisotumab vedotin had the highest hospitalization rate at 26.67%, followed by brentuximab vedotin at 25.5%. Trastuzumab emtansine had the highest mortality rate ,with 80 deaths (11.96%) among 669 cases. Based on FAERS database, only ADCs with tubulin-binding payloads exhibited significant peripheral neuropathy signals. Brentuximab vedotin and enfortumab vedotin showed similar profiles for peripheral sensory neuropathy and motor neuropathy. Given the delayed time to onset and potentially poor outcomes, ADC-related peripheral neuropathy warrants significant attention."}

Balasooriya", "Johannes Kreuzer", "Robert Morris", "Albert S. Baldwin", "Dejan Juric", "Wilhelm Haas", "Nabeel Bardeesy"], "abstract": "Genomic alterations that activate Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) are common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. However, the depth and duration of response is often limited. Here, we conduct integrative transcriptomics, metabolomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis of patient-derived models to define pathways downstream of oncogenic FGFR2 signaling that fuel ICC growth and to uncover compensatory mechanisms associated with pathway inhibition. We find that FGFR2-mediated activation of Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) maintains a highly glycolytic phenotype. Conversely, FGFR inhibition blocks glucose uptake and glycolysis while inciting adaptive changes, including switching fuel source utilization favoring fatty acid oxidation and increasing mitochondrial fusion and autophagy. Accordingly, FGFR inhibitor efficacy is potentiated by combined mitochondrial targeting, an effect enhanced in xenograft models by intermittent fasting. Thus, we show that oncogenic FGFR2 signaling drives NF-\u03baB-dependent glycolysis in ICC and that metabolic reprogramming in response to FGFR inhibition confers new targetable vulnerabilities."}

Here, we use single-cell and imaging-based spatial analysis to elucidate three microenvironmental neighborhoods surrounding the heterogeneous basal cell carcinoma tumor epithelia. Within the highly proliferative neighborhood, we find that TREM2+ skin cancer-associated macrophages (SCAMs) support the proliferation of a distinct tumor epithelial population through an immunosuppression-independent manner via oncostatin-M/JAK-STAT3 signaling. SCAMs represent a unique tumor-specific TREM2+ population defined by VCAM1 surface expression that is not found in normal homeostatic skin or during wound healing. Furthermore, SCAMs actively proliferate and self-propagate through multiple serial tumor passages, indicating long-term potential. The tumor rapidly drives SCAM differentiation, with intratumoral injections sufficient to instruct naive bone marrow-derived monocytes to polarize within days. This work provides mechanistic insights into direct tumor-immune niche dynamics independent of immunosuppression, providing the basis for potential combination tumor therapies."}

Tregs actively adapt to the microenvironment where they reside; as a consequence, their molecular and functional profiles differ among tissues and pathologies. In tumors, the features acquired by Tregs remains poorly characterized. Here, we observe that human tumor-infiltrating Tregs selectively overexpress CD74, the MHC class II invariant chain. CD74 has been previously described as a regulator of antigen-presenting cell biology, however its function in Tregs remains unknown. CD74 genetic deletion in human primary Tregs reveals that CD74KO Tregs exhibit major defects in the organization of their actin cytoskeleton and intracellular organelles. Additionally, intratumoral CD74KO Tregs show a decreased activation, a drop in Foxp3 expression, a low accumulation in the tumor, and consistently, they are associated with accelerated tumor rejection in preclinical models in female mice. These observations are unique to tumor conditions as, at steady state, CD74KO-Treg phenotype, survival, and suppressive capacity are unaffected in vitro and in vivo. CD74 therefore emerges as a specific regulator of tumor-infiltrating Tregs and as a target to interfere with Treg anti-tumor activity."}

Validating various classification models predicting treatment duration with ARSI on our internal and external mCRPC cohort reveals two best-performing models, based on the combination of prior treatment information with either the four combined enriched genomic markers or with overall transcriptomic profiles. In conclusion, predictive models combining genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data can predict response to ARSI in mCRPC patients and, with additional optimization and prospective validation, could improve treatment guidance."}

However, the specific roles of different subpopulations of TAMs remain poorly understood. Two distinct cell types, glioma and myeloid cells, were identified through single-cell sequencing analysis in gliomas. Within the TAMs-associated weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) module, FPR3 emerged as a hub gene and was found to be expressed on CD163+ macrophages, while also being associated with clinical outcomes. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment was undertaken to investigate the correlation between FPR3 expression and immune characteristics, revealing that FPR3 potentially plays a role in reshaping the glioma microenvironment. We identified a macrophage subset with the nonzero expression of CD163 and FPR3 (CD163+FPR3+). Using the expression profiles of CD163+FPR3+ macrophage-related signature, we employed ten machine learning algorithms to construct a prognostic model across six glioma cohorts. Subsequently, we employed an optimal algorithm to generate an artificial intelligence-driven prognostic signature specifically for CD163+FPR3+ macrophages. The development of this model was based on the average C-index observed in the aforementioned six cohorts. The risk score of this model consistently and effectively predicted overall survival, surpassing the accuracy of conventional clinical factors and 100 previously published signatures. Consequently, the CD163+FPR3+ macrophage-related score shows potential as a prognostic biomarker for glioma patients."}

A promising strategy that has emerged is the combination of chemotherapy with gas therapy. We synthesized curcumin-loaded amorphous calcium carbonate nanoparticles (Cur-CaCO3) via a gas diffusion reaction in the present study. Subsequently, a \"one-step\" ethanol injection method was employed to fabricate lipid-coated calcium carbonate nanoparticles (Cur-CaCO3@LA-Lip) loaded with L-arginine, aimed at harnessing the synergistic effects of chemotherapy and nitric oxide to enhance antitumor efficacy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that Cur-CaCO3@LA-Lip nanoparticles were subspherical with a distinct lipid layer encapsulating the periphery. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry results confirmed the successful synthesis of Cur-CaCO3@LA-Lip. The nanoparticles exhibited significant drug loading capacities of 8.89% for curcumin and 3.1% for L-arginine. In vitro and in vivo assessments demonstrated that Cur-CaCO3@LA-Lip nanoparticles facilitated sustained release of curcumin and exhibited high cellular uptake, substantial tumor accumulation, and excellent biocompatibility. Additionally, the nanoparticles showed robust cytotoxicity and potent antitumor efficacy, suggesting their potential as a formidable candidate for breast cancer therapy. "}

With a growing number of immune markers analysed, digital image analysis may facilitate broader TIME understanding, even in single-plex IHC data. To facilitate analyses of the latter an open-source image analysis pipeline, Tissue microarray MArker Quantification (TMArQ), was developed and applied to single-plex stainings for p53, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, FOXP3, and PD-L1 (SP142 antibody) in a 218-patient triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cohort with complementary pathology scorings, clinicopathological, whole genome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data. TMArQ\u2019s cell counts for analysed immune markers were on par with results from alternative methods and consistent with both estimates from human pathology review, different quantifications and classifications derived from RNA-sequencing as well as known prognostic patterns of immune response in TNBC. The digital cell counts demonstrated how immune markers are coexpressed in the TIME when considering TNBC molecular subtypes and DNA repair deficiency, and how combination of immune status with DNA repair deficiency status can improve the prognostic stratification in chemotherapy treated patients. These results underscore the value and potential of integrating TIME and specific tumour intrinsic alterations/phenotypes for the molecular understanding of TNBC."}

Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic medication, has demonstrated potential in enhancing progression-free survival (PFS) in EOC patients. Nevertheless, the identification of individuals at elevated risk of disease progression following treatment remains a challenging task. This study was to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model using retrospectively collected computed tomography (CT) plain scans of inoperable and recurrent EOC patients receiving bevacizumab treatment diagnosed between January 2013 and January 2024. A total of 525 patients from three different institutions were retrospectively included in the study and divided into training set (N\u2009=\u2009400), internal test set (N\u2009=\u200997) and external test set (N\u2009=\u200928). The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using Harrell\u2019s C-index. Patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk group based on a predetermined cutoff in the training set. Additionally, a multimodal model was evaluated, incorporating the risk score generated by the DL model and the pretreatment level of carbohydrate antigen 125 as input variables. The Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) metric quantified the reclassification performance of our optimal model in comparison to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging model. The results indicated that DL model achieved a PFS predictive C-index of 0.73 in the internal test set and a C-index of 0.61 in the external test set, along with hazard ratios of 34.24 in the training set (95% CI: 21.7, 54.1; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 8.16 in the internal test set (95% CI: 2.5, 26.8; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The multimodal model demonstrated a C-index of 0.76 in the internal test set and a C-index of 0.64 in the external test set. Comparative analysis against FIGO staging revealed an NRI of 0.06 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) for the multimodal model.

Here, we characterize the immunometabolic profiles of tumor tissue samples longitudinally collected from individuals with breast cancer before, during and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using proteomics, genomics and histopathology. We show that the pre-, on-treatment and dynamic changes of the immune state, tumor metabolic proteins and tumor cell gene expression profiling-based metabolic phenotype are associated with treatment response. Single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing revealed distinct tumor and immune cell states in metabolism between cold and hot tumors. Potential drivers of NAC based on above analyses were validated in vitro. In summary, the study shows that the interaction of tumor-intrinsic metabolic states and TME is associated with treatment outcome, supporting the concept of targeting tumor metabolism for immunoregulation."}

However, approximately 30-50% of patients exhibit primary resistance (PR) to FLT3i with poorly defined mechanisms, posing a pressing clinical unmet need. Here, we identify C/EBP\u03b1 activation as a top PR feature by analyzing data from primary AML patient samples in Vizome. C/EBP\u03b1 activation limit FLT3i efficacy, while its inactivation synergistically enhances FLT3i action in cellular and female animal models. We then perform an in silico screen and identify that guanfacine, an antihypertensive medication, mimics C/EBP\u03b1 inactivation. Furthermore, guanfacine exerts a synergistic effect with FLT3i in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we ascertain the role of C/EBP\u03b1 activation in PR in an independent cohort of FLT3-ITD patients. These findings highlight C/EBP\u03b1 activation as a targetable PR mechanism and support clinical studies aimed at testing the combination of guanfacine with FLT3i in overcoming PR and enhancing the efficacy of FLT3i therapy."}

Three patient-derived PDACs were transplanted into the livers of 21 rats each (totally, 63 rats), randomly assigned into hepatic arterial infusion, systemic venous infusion, and control groups (n\u2009=\u20097 each) four weeks post-implantation. Computed tomography evaluated tumor volumes before and four weeks after treatment. Post-euthanasia, resected tumor specimens underwent histopathological examination. A liver-implanted PDAC PDX rat model was established in all 63 rats, with first CT identifying all tumors. Four weeks post-treatment, arterial infusion groups exhibited significantly smaller tumor volumes than controls for all three tumors on second CT. Xenograft tumors histologically maintained adenocarcinoma features compared to original patient tumors. Ki67 expression was significantly lower in arterial infusion groups than in the other two for the three tumors, indicating reduced tumor growth in PDX rats. A liver-implanted PDAC PDX rat model was established as a rat-based preclinical platform. Arterial cisplatin infusion chemotherapy represents a potential therapy for PDAC liver metastasis."}

Data from Asian EC patients were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was used for initial variable selection, followed by multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify independent prognostic factors. A nomogram was subsequently constructed based on these factors. The predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves, while the clinical utility of the nomogram was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA). The LASSO regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis identified age, sex, marital status, tumor size, M stage, surgery, and chemotherapy as independent prognostic factors. The ROC curve results demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS in the training cohort were 0.770, 0.756, and 0.783, respectively. In the validation cohort, the AUC values were 0.814, 0.763, and 0.771, respectively. Calibration curves indicated a high concordance between predicted and actual OS. The DCA demonstrated that the nomogram has significant clinical applicability. This nomogram provides reliable predictions and valuable guidance for personalized survival estimates and high-risk patient identification."}

MYC oncoprotein is elevated in G3 MB tumors; however, the mechanisms that support MYC abundance remain unclear. Using metabolic and mechanistic profiling, we pinpoint a role for mitochondrial metabolism in regulating MYC. Complex-I inhibition decreases MYC abundance in G3 MB, attenuates the expression of MYC-downstream targets, induces differentiation, and prolongs male animal survival. Mechanistically, complex-I inhibition increases inactivating acetylation of antioxidant enzyme SOD2 at K68 and K122, triggering the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that promotes MYC oxidation and degradation in a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-dependent manner. MPC inhibition blocks the acetylation of SOD2 and oxidation of MYC, restoring MYC abundance and self-renewal capacity in G3 MB cells following complex-I inhibition. Identification of this MPC-SOD2 signaling axis reveals a role for metabolism in regulating MYC protein abundance that has clinical implications for treating G3 MB."}

It generates semiquantitative index (SQI) values that correlate with mutant allele levels, but decision thresholds for clinical use in NSCLC surveillance are lacking. We conducted long-term ctDNA monitoring in 20 subjects with EGFR-mutated NSCLC; resulting in a 155 on-treatment samples. We defined optimal SQI intervals to predict/rule-out progression within 12\u00a0weeks from sampling and performed orthogonal calibration versus deep-sequencing and digital PCR. SQI showed significant diagnostic power (AUC 0.848, 95% CI 0.782\u20130.901). SQI below 5 (63% of samples) had 93% (95% CI 87\u201396%) NPV, while SQI above 10 (25% of samples) had 69% (95% CI 56\u201380%) PPV. Cobas EGFR showed perfect agreement with sequencing (Kappa 0.860; 95% CI 0.674\u20131.00) and digital PCR. SQI values strongly (r: 0.910, 95% 0.821\u20130.956) correlated to mutant allele concentrations with SQI of 5 and 10 corresponding to 6\u20139 (0.2\u20130.3%) and 64\u2013105 (1.1\u20131.6%) mutant allele copies/mL (VAF) respectively.

Immune check point blockade (ICB) therapy using PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has been approved in several types of advanced SCCs. However, low response rate and treatment resistance are common. Improving the efficacy of ICB therapy requires better understanding of the mechanism of immune evasion. Here, we identify that the SCC-master transcription factor TP63 suppresses interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) signaling. TP63 inhibition leads to increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and heighten tumor killing in in vivo syngeneic mouse model and ex vivo co-culture system, respectively. Moreover, expression of TP63 is negatively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in patients with SCC. Silencing of TP63 enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1 blockade by promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration and functionality. Mechanistically, TP63 and STAT1 mutually suppress each other to regulate the IFN\u03b3 signaling by co-occupying and co-regulating their own promoters and enhancers. Together, our findings elucidate a tumor-extrinsic function of TP63 in promoting immune evasion of SCC cells. Over-expression of TP63 may serve as a biomarker predicting the outcome of SCC patients treated with ICB therapy, and targeting TP63/STAT/IFN\u03b3 axis may enhance the efficacy of ICB therapy for this deadly cancer."}

Here we show that circulating lactate levels positively correlate with the degree of body weight loss in male and female patients suffering from cancer cachexia, as well as in clinically relevant mouse models. Lactate infusion per se is sufficient to trigger a cachectic phenotype in tumour-free mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adipose-specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)81 ablation, similarly to global GPR81 deficiency, ameliorates lactate-induced or tumour-induced adipose and muscle wasting in male mice, revealing adipose GPR81 as the major mediator of the catabolic effects of lactate. Mechanistically, lactate/GPR81-induced cachexia occurs independently of the well-established protein kinase A catabolic pathway, but it is mediated by a signalling cascade sequentially activating Gi\u2013G\u03b2\u03b3\u2013RhoA/ROCK1\u2013p38.

Three of 7 enrolled MTAPdef patients show response to pemetrexed (ORR 43%). Furthermore, a historic cohort shows 4 of 4 MTAPdef patients respond to pemetrexed as compared to 1 of 10 MTAP-proficient patients. In vitro and in vivo preclinical data using UC cell lines demonstrate increased sensitivity to pemetrexed by inducing DNA damage, and distorting nucleotide pools. In addition, MTAP-knockdown increases sensitivity to pemetrexed. Furthermore, in a lung adenocarcinoma retrospective cohort (N\u2009=\u200972) from the published BATTLE2 clinical trial (NCT01248247), MTAPdef associates with an improved response rate to pemetrexed. Our data demonstrate a synthetic lethal interaction between MTAPdef and de novo purine inhibition, which represents a promising therapeutic strategy for larger prospective trials."}

It is unknown to what extent the current genomic findings represent populations with different ethnic backgrounds. Here we present the genomic landscape of driver alterations of Chinese pediatric AML and discover previously undescribed genomic aberrations, including the XPO1-TNRC18 fusion. Comprehensively comparing between the Chinese and Western AML cohorts reveal a substantially distinct genomic alteration profile. For example, Chinese AML patients more commonly exhibit mutations in KIT and CSF3R, and less frequently mutated of genes in the RAS signaling pathway. These differences in mutation frequencies lead to the detection of previously uncharacterized co-occurring mutation pairs. Importantly, the distinct driver profile is clinical relevant. We propose a refined prognosis risk classification model which better reflected the adverse event risk for Chinese AML patients. These results emphasize the importance of genetic background in precision medicine."}

However, genetic studies on the role of SHP2 in tumor angiogenesis have not been conducted. Here, we show that SHP2 is activated in tumor endothelia. Shp2 deletion and pharmacological inhibition reduce tumor growth and microvascular density in multiple mouse tumor models. Shp2 deletion also leads to tumor vascular normalization, indicated by increased pericyte coverage and vessel perfusion. SHP2 inefficiency impairs endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis through downregulating the expression of proangiogenic SRY-Box transcription factor 7 (SOX7), whose re-expression restores endothelial function in SHP2-knockdown cells and tumor growth, angiogenesis, and vascular abnormalization in Shp2-deleted mice. SHP2 stabilizes apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which regulates SOX7 expression mediated by c-Jun. Our studies suggest SHP2 in tumor associated endothelial cells is a promising anti-angiogenic target for cancer therapy."}

However, the efficacy of radiotherapy is limited by hypoxia-mediated radioresistance and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment.

We demonstrate that the nanoprobes effectively aggregate in the tumor site to locate the tumor region, thereby realizing precision radiotherapy with few side-effects. In addition, nanoprobes relieve intratumoral hypoxia and reduce the tumor infiltration of immunosuppressive cells. Moreover, the nanoprobes promote the immunogenic cell death of cancer cells to trigger the activation of dendritic cells and enhance T cell-mediated antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor metastasis. Collectively, the nanoprobe-mediated immunogenic radiotherapy can boost the abscopal effect to inhibit tumor metastasis and prolong survival."}

Although the role of telomere length in cancer has been well studied, its association to genomic features is less well known. Here, we report the telomere lengths of 392 localized prostate cancer tumours and characterize their relationship to genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic features. Shorter tumour telomere lengths are associated with elevated genomic instability, including single-nucleotide variants, indels and structural variants. Genes involved in cell proliferation and signaling are correlated with tumour telomere length at all levels of the central dogma. Telomere length is also associated with multiple clinical features of a tumour. Longer telomere lengths in non-tumour samples are associated with a lower rate of biochemical relapse. In summary, we describe the multi-level integration of telomere length, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics in localized prostate cancer."}

We further establish a subtyping scheme based on the molecular features of malignant T cells and their pro-tumorigenic microenvironments: the TCyEM group, demonstrating a cytotoxic effector memory T cell phenotype, shows more M2 macrophages infiltration, while the TCM group, featured by a central memory T cell phenotype and adverse patient outcome, is infiltrated by highly exhausted CD8+ reactive T cells, B cells and Tregs with suppressive activities. Our results establish a solid basis for understanding the nature of CTCL and pave the way for future precision medicine for CTCL patients."}

Here we report long-term clinical outcomes of a randomized multicenter phase II clinical trial (NCT00118274), where patients with high-risk melanoma received a multipeptide vaccine targeting CD8+ T cells (12MP) and were randomized to receive either of two vaccines for CD4+ (helper) T cells: 6MHP (6 melanoma-specific helper peptides), or tet (a nonspecific helper peptide from tetanus toxoid). Cyclophosphamide (Cy) pre-treatment was also assessed. Primary outcomes for T cell responses to 12MP, 6MHP, and tet were previously reported, suggesting immunogenicity of both vaccines but that CD8 T cell responses to 12MP were lower when tet was replaced with 6MHP. Here, in post-hoc analyses, we report durable prolongation of overall survival by adding 6MHP instead of tet. That benefit was experienced only by male patients. A favorable interaction of 6MHP and Cy is also suggested. Multivariable Cox regression analysis of the intent-to-treat population identify vaccine arm (12MP\u2009+\u20096MHP+Cy) and patient sex (male) as the two significant predictors of enhanced survival.

Two abdominal radiologists independently reviewed each scan for image quality of the abdomen, the diagnostic confidence per system (gastrointestinalsystem/organs/peritoneum/retroperitoneum/lymph nodes) and overall diagnostic confidence to address the clinical question (not able/partial able/fully able). Radiation exposure was extracted from dose reports. Differences between both groups were evaluated by Student\u2019s t-test, Mann-Whitney-U-test or chi-square-test. Of the 320participants, 233chose water only. All baseline characteristics, image quality of the abdomen and the diagnostic confidence of the organs were comparable between groups and both observers. Diagnostic confidence in the water only group was more commonly scored as less than good by observer1. The results were as follows: the gastrointestinal system(18/233vs1/87; p\u2009=\u20090.031), peritoneum (21/233vs1/87; p\u2009=\u20090.012), retroperitoneum (11/233vs0/87; p\u2009=\u20090.040) and lymph nodes (11/233vs0/87; p\u2009=\u20090.040).

The diagnostic confidence to address the clinical question could be partially addressed in 6/233 vs 0/87 patients (p\u2009=\u20090.259). The water only group showed a tendency towards less radiation exposure. In summary, most scan ratings were comparable between positive contrast and water only, but slightly favored positive oral contrast for one reader for some abdominal structures.

Trial-level data on OS and common and serious adverse events (AE) were extracted for each drug. In the absence of direct comparisons, a network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate pairwise comparative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of each of the CDK4/6i. Seven studies comprising of 4415 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 73.3\u00a0months (range: 48.7\u201397.2\u00a0months). There were no statistically significant differences in OS between any of the CDK4/6i. Compared to palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib both showed significantly higher GI toxicity (grade 1\u20132 vomiting OR 1.87 [95% CI 1.37\u20132.56] and OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.59\u20133.23] respectively). Compared to palbociclib, abemaciclib was associated with more grade 3\u20134 diarrhea OR 118.06 [95% CI 7.28\u20131915.32]. In contrast, palbociclib was associated with significantly more neutropenia than ribociclib and abemaciclib but significantly lower risk of grade 3\u20134 infections. Abemaciclib had significantly less grade 3\u20134 transaminitis and grade 3\u20134 neutropenia than ribociclib. Treatment discontinuation and death due to AE were significantly higher with abemaciclib than palbociclib and ribociclib. There is no statistically significant difference in OS between CDK4/6i despite differing statistical significance levels of individual trials. Real-world data analyses may help to identify if there is a meaningful inter-drug difference in efficacy. Significant differences between CDK4/6i are observed for safety and tolerability outcomes."}

For the RP prediction models, 275 non-small-cell lung cancer patients consisted of 245 training (22 with grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 RP) and 30 test cases (8 with grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 RP) were selected. A total of 486 radiomic features were calculated to quantify the RP texture patterns reflecting radiation-induced tissue reaction within lung volumes irradiated with more than x Gy, which were defined as LVx. Ten subsets consisting of all 22 RP cases and 22 or 23 randomly selected non-RP cases were created from the imbalanced dataset of 245 training patients. For each subset, signatures were constructed, and predictive models were built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression. An ensemble averaging model was built by averaging the RP probabilities of the 10 models. The best model areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) calculated on the training and test cohort for LV5 were 0.871 and 0.756, respectively. The radiomic features calculated on pretreatment planning CT images could be predictive imaging biomarkers for RP after lung cancer SBRT."}

Mabjeesh"], "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to\u00a0assess the predictive value of prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in men undergoing systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. We retrospectively analyzed data of men who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy because of elevated PSA (\u2264\u200920\u00a0ng/ml) or abnormal digital rectal examination. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to compare PSA and PSAD performance and chi-square automatic interaction detector methodologies were used to identify predictors of clinically significant cancer (Gleason score\u2009\u2265\u20097 or international society of urological pathology grade group\u2009\u2265\u20092). Nine-hundred and ninety-two consecutive men with a median age of 66\u00a0years (IQR 61\u201371) were included in the study. Median PSAD was 0.10\u00a0ng/ml2 (IQR 0.10\u20130.22). Prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 338 men (34%). Clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 167 patients (50% of all cancers and 17% of the whole cohort). The AUC to predict clinically significant prostate cancer was 0.64 for PSA and 0.78 for PSAD (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The highest Youden's index for PSAD was at 0.20\u00a0ng/ml2 with 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity for the diagnosis of clinically significant cancer. Men with PSAD\u2009<\u20090.09\u00a0ng/ml2 had only 4% chance of having clinically significant disease. The detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSAD between 0.09 and 0.19\u00a0ng/ml2 was significantly higher when prostate volume was less than 33\u00a0ml. In conclusion,\u00a0PSAD was a better predictor than PSA alone of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients undergoing TRUS-guided biopsy. Patients with PSAD below 0.09\u00a0ng/ml2 were unlikely to harbor clinically significant prostate cancer. Combining PSAD in the gray zone (0.09\u20130.19) with prostate volume below 33\u00a0ml adds diagnostic value of clinically significant prostate cancer."}

From 2007 to 2015, nineteen patients with primary malignant peri-acetabulum tumors were enrolled. All cases underwent single column resection with clear surgical margins. Ten of the 19 tumor\u2019s resections were assisted by computer navigation. Femoral heads were applied to reconstruct anterior or posterior column defects; THR was used for joint reconstruction. The surgical safety, oncologic outcome and prosthesis survivorship and function were evaluated by regular follow-up. The average follow-up period was 65.9\u00a0months. Surgical margins contained wide resection in 12 cases and marginal resection in 7 cases. One patient with Ewing's sarcoma died 14\u00a0months postoperative due to lung metastasis. One case with chondrosarcoma had recurrence. One prosthesis was removed due to infection. The average MusculoSkeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) function score was 83.7%. Due to the relative small number of cases, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate and prosthesis failure rate between the navigation group and non-navigation group. Single column resection and reconstruction with femoral head autograft plus THR is an effective, safe method with less complication rate and better functional outcome for patients with peri-acetabular tumors."}

However, post-mortem blood has not been subjected to genetic analyses in relation to cancer. We first confirmed that substantial quantities of cell-free DNA were present in the post-mortem plasma of 12 autopsy cases. Then, we focused on a pilot case of prostate cancer with multiple metastases for genetic analyses. Whole-exome sequencing of post-mortem plasma-derived cell-free DNA and eight frozen metastatic cancer tissues collected during rapid autopsy was performed, and compared their mutational statuses. The post-mortem plasma cell-free DNA was successfully sequenced and 344 mutations were identified. Of these, 160 were detected in at least one of the metastases. Further, 99% of the mutations shared by all metastases were present in the plasma. Sanger sequencing of 30 additional formalin-fixed metastases enabled us to map the clones harboring mutations initially detected only in the plasma. In conclusion, post-mortem blood, which is usually disposed of during conventional autopsies, can provide valuable data if sequenced in detail, especially regarding cancer heterogeneity. Furthermore, post-mortem plasma cell-free DNA sequencing (liquid autopsy) can be a novel platform for cancer research and a tool for genomic pathology."}

Here, we included 127 GBM patients, 78 of whom were randomly allocated to the training and test cohorts for pathomics modeling. The prognostic significance of MMP9 was assessed using Kaplan\u2013Meier and Cox regression analyses. PyRadiomics was used to extract the features of H&E-stained whole slide images. Feature selection was performed using the maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithms. Prediction models were created using support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). The performance was assessed using ROC analysis, calibration curve assessment, and decision curve analysis. MMP9 expression was elevated in patients with GBM. This was an independent prognostic factor for GBM. Six features were selected for the pathomics model. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the training and test subsets were 0.828 and 0.808, respectively, for the SVM model and 0.778 and 0.754, respectively, for the LR model. The C-index and calibration plots exhibited effective estimation abilities. The pathomics score calculated using the SVM model was highly correlated with overall survival time. These findings indicate that MMP9 plays a crucial role in GBM development and prognosis. Our pathomics model demonstrated high efficacy for predicting MMP9 expression levels and prognosis of patients with GBM."}
{"title": "The global burden of lung cancer: current status and future trends", "published": "21 July 2023", "authors": ["Amanda Leiter", "Rajwanth R. Veluswamy", "Juan P. Wisnivesky"], "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. However, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates differ substantially across the world, reflecting varying patterns of tobacco smoking, exposure to environmental risk factors and genetics. Tobacco smoking is the leading risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancer incidence largely reflects trends in smoking patterns, which generally vary by sex and economic development. For this reason, tobacco control campaigns are a central part of global strategies designed to reduce lung cancer mortality. Environmental and occupational lung cancer risk factors, such as unprocessed biomass fuels, asbestos, arsenic and radon, can also contribute to lung cancer incidence in certain parts of the world. Over the past decade, large-cohort clinical studies have established that low-dose CT screening reduces lung cancer mortality, largely owing to increased diagnosis and treatment at earlier disease stages. These data have led to recommendations that individuals with a high risk of lung cancer undergo screening in several economically developed countries and increased implementation of screening worldwide. In this Review, we provide an overview of the global epidemiology of lung cancer. Lung cancer risk factors and global risk reduction efforts are also discussed. Finally, we summarize lung cancer screening policies and their implementation worldwide."}

This study proposes a novel compensatory approach for delivering the required neutron fluence and validates its clinical applicability. The proposed approach relies on the neutron flux model and the cumulative sum of real-time measurements of proton charges. The accuracy of delivering the required neutron fluence for BNCT using the proposed approach was examined in five Li targets. With the proposed approach, the required neutron fluence could be delivered within 3.0%, and within 1.0% in most cases. However, those without using the proposed approach exceeded 3.0% in some cases. The proposed approach can consider the neutron flux reduction adequately and decrease the effect of uncertainty in neutron measurements. Therefore, the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of delivering the required fluence for BNCT even if a neutron flux reduction is expected during treatment and over the lifetime of the Li target. Additionally, by adequately revising the approach, it may apply to other type of BNCT systems employing a Li target, furthering research in this direction."}

Abdallah"], "abstract": "Due to vincristine sulfate\u2019s (VCR sulfate) toxicity and non-specific targeting, which might adversely damage healthy cells, its clinical application is restricted. In this study, we loaded VCR sulfate on exosomes generated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to enhance its targeted distribution. Exosomes are able to deliver molecules to specific cells and tissues and have therapeutic potential. In this study, we isolated exosomes from MSCs, and using probe-sonication approach loaded them with VCR sulfate. Using SRB assay, the cytotoxicity of VCR sulfate-Exo was assessed in T47D breast cancer cells, and the results were contrasted with those of free VCR sulfate. Then We labeled markers (CD44+/CD24\u2212) in the cell line to assess the targeting effectiveness of VCR sulfate-Exo using flow cytometry. Our results showed that the cytotoxicity of VCR sulfate-Exo was nearly the same as that of VCR sulfate. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that VRC sulfate-Exo was more effectively targeted to MSCs than free VCR sulfate. Our study shows that loading VCR sulfate to MSCs-derived exosomes can improve their targeted delivery and lessen their side effects. Additional research is required to determine VCR sulfate-Exo\u2019s in vivo effectiveness and safety and improve the loading and delivery strategies."}

Fibroblasts and macrophages are heterogeneous cell populations able to enhance metastasis, but the role of a macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk in regulating their pro-metastatic functions remains poorly understood. Here we deconvolve how macrophages regulate metastasis-associated fibroblast (MAF) heterogeneity in the liver. We identify three functionally distinct MAF populations, among which the generation of pro-metastatic and immunoregulatory myofibroblastic-MAFs (myMAFs) critically depends on macrophages. Mechanistically, myMAFs are induced through a STAT3-dependent mechanism driven by macrophage-derived progranulin and cancer cell-secreted leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In a reciprocal manner, myMAF secreted osteopontin promotes an immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype resulting in the inhibition of cytotoxic T cell functions. Pharmacological blockade of STAT3 or myMAF-specific genetic depletion of STAT3 restores an anti-tumour immune response and reduces metastases. Our findings provide molecular insights into the complex macrophage\u2013fibroblast interactions in tumours and reveal potential targets to inhibit PDAC liver metastasis."}

Here, we show a reduction in fecal microbiota alpha-diversity correlating with increase tumour burden in two distinct groups of hormonotherapy na\u00efve PCa patients and three murine PCa models. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients with high PCa volume is sufficient to stimulate the growth of mouse PCa revealing the existence of a gut microbiome-cancer crosstalk. Analysis of gut microbial-related pathways in mice with aggressive PCa identifies three enzymes responsible for the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). Supplementation with LCFA omega-3 MAG-EPA is sufficient to reduce PCa growth in mice and cancer up-grading in pre-prostatectomy PCa patients correlating with a reduction of gut Ruminococcaceae\u00a0in both and fecal butyrate levels in PCa patients. This suggests that the beneficial effect of omega-3 rich diet is mediated in part by modulating the crosstalk between gut microbes and their metabolites in men with PCa."}

Docking simulations indicated no steric hindrance between BPI-28592 and TRK mutants, suggesting its potential to overcome drug resistance. Biochemical assays showed strong inhibition and high selectivity against TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. The inhibitor significantly reduced cell proliferation and blocked TRK signaling. In vivo studies demonstrated effective tumor suppression in xenograft models harboring TRK fusions with or without resistant mutations. Clinically, BPI-28592 achieved a complete response in a patient with malignant melanoma carrying an AP3S2-NTRK3 fusion (Clinicaltrials. gov identifier: NCT05302843)."}

The primary objective of the BTC cohort, which is now complete, is first objective response rate (ORR) to neratinib 240\u2009mg orally daily. Secondary objectives include confirmed ORR, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, safety and tolerability. Genomic analyses were exploratory. Among 25 treatment-refractory patients (11 cholangiocarcinoma, 10 gallbladder, 4 ampullary cancers), the ORR is 16% (95% CI 4.5\u201336.1%). The most common HER2 mutations are S310F (n\u2009=\u200911; 48%) and V777L (n\u2009=\u20094; 17%). Outcomes appear worse for ampullary tumours or those with co-occurring oncogenic TP53 and CDKN2A alterations. Loss of amplified HER2 S310F and acquisition of multiple previously undetected oncogenic co-mutations are identified at progression in one responder. Diarrhoea is the most common adverse event, with any-grade diarrhoea in 14 patients (56%).

The effects of disrupting this pathway on T-cells are being actively explored and controversial outcomes have been reported. Here, we hypothesize that CAR-antigen affinity may be a key factor modulating T-cell susceptibility towards the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. We systematically interrogate CAR-T cells targeting HER2 with either low (LA) or high affinity (HA) in various preclinical models. Our results reveal an increased sensitivity of LA CAR-T cells to PD-L1-mediated inhibition when compared to their HA counterparts by using in vitro models of tumor cell lines and supported lipid bilayers modified to display varying PD-L1 densities. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of PD-1 enhances LA CAR-T cell cytokine secretion and polyfunctionality in vitro and antitumor effect in vivo and results in the downregulation of gene signatures related to T-cell exhaustion. By contrast, HA CAR-T cell features remain unaffected following PD-1 KO. This behavior holds true for CD28 and ICOS but not 4-1BB co-stimulated CAR-T cells, which are less sensitive to PD-L1 inhibition albeit targeting the antigen with LA. Our findings may inform CAR-T therapies involving disruption of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway tailored in particular for effective treatment of solid tumors."}

Converting resistant tumors to immunotherapy sensitive will provide a significant improvement in patient outcome. Here we identify Mi-2\u03b2 as a key melanoma-intrinsic effector regulating the adaptive anti-tumor immune response. Studies in genetically engineered mouse melanoma models indicate that loss of Mi-2\u03b2 rescues the immune response to immunotherapy in vivo. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq analysis shows that Mi-2\u03b2 controls the accessibility of IFN-\u03b3-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mi-2\u03b2 binds to EZH2 and promotes K510 methylation of EZH2, subsequently activating the trimethylation of H3K27 to inhibit the transcription of ISGs. Finally, we develop an Mi-2\u03b2-targeted inhibitor, Z36-MP5, which reduces Mi-2\u03b2 ATPase activity and reactivates ISG transcription. Consequently, Z36-MP5 induces a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in otherwise resistant melanoma models. Our work provides a potential therapeutic strategy to convert immunotherapy resistant melanomas to sensitive ones."}

Resetting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising strategy to enhance T-cell antitumor immunity and ameliorate tumor immunosuppression. Here, mannose-modified macrophage-derived microparticles (Man-MPs) loading metformin (Met@Man-MPs) are developed to efficiently target to M2-like TAMs to repolarize into M1-like phenotype. Met@Man-MPs-reset TAMs remodel the tumor immune microenvironment by increasing the recruitment of CD8+ T cells into tumor tissues and decreasing immunosuppressive infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. More importantly, the collagen-degrading capacity of Man-MPs contributes to the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor interiors and enhances tumor accumulation and penetration of anti-PD-1 antibody. These unique features of Met@Man-MPs contribute to boost anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, improving anticancer efficacy and long-term memory immunity after combination treatment. Our results support Met@Man-MPs as a potential drug to improve tumor resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy."}

To identify unrecognized regulators of cell survival we performed a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen using treatment with ionizing radiation as a selective pressure, and identified STING (stimulator of interferon genes) as an intrinsic regulator of tumor cell survival. We show that STING regulates a transcriptional program that controls the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that STING loss alters ROS homeostasis to reduce DNA damage and to cause therapeutic resistance. In agreement with these data, analysis of tumors from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient specimens show that low STING expression is associated with worse outcomes. We also demonstrate that pharmacologic activation of STING enhances the effects of ionizing radiation in vivo, providing a rationale for therapeutic combinations of STING agonists and DNA-damaging agents. These results highlight a role for STING that is beyond its canonical function in cyclic dinucleotide and DNA damage sensing, and identify STING as a regulator of cellular ROS homeostasis and tumor cell susceptibility to reactive oxygen dependent, DNA damaging agents."}

Tumors of patients who derive clinical benefit\u00a0from ICB exhibit cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, high expression of antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM) genes, and low neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. However, elevated Notch signaling, which positively correlates with low NE differentiation, most significantly predicts clinical benefit to ICB.

Ceralasertib suppresses proliferating CD8+ T-cells on treatment which is rapidly reversed off-treatment. Ceralasertib causes up-regulation of type I interferon (IFNI) pathway in cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. IFNI is experimentally found to be a major mediator of antitumor activity of ceralasertib in combination with PD-L1 antibody. Improvement of T-cell function after ceralasertib treatment is linked to changes in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. IFNI also promotes anti-proliferative effects of ceralasertib on tumor cells.

Lanman", "MacKenzie McIntosh", "Sandro Matosevic"], "abstract": "Severe heterogeneity within glioblastoma has spurred the notion that disrupting the interplay between multiple elements on immunosuppression is at the core of meaningful anti-tumor responses. T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) and its glioblastoma-associated antigen, CD155, form a highly immunosuppressive axis in glioblastoma and other solid tumors, yet targeting of TIGIT, a functionally heterogeneous receptor on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, has largely been ineffective as monotherapy, suggesting that disruption of its inhibitory network might be necessary for measurable responses. It is within this context that we show that the usurpation of the TIGIT\u2009\u2212\u2009CD155 axis via engineered synNotch-mediated activation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived natural killer (NK) cells promotes transcription factor-mediated activation of a downstream signaling cascade that results in the controlled, localized blockade of CD73 to disrupt purinergic activity otherwise resulting in the production and accumulation of immunosuppressive extracellular adenosine. Such \u201cdecoy\u201d receptor engages CD155 binding to TIGIT, but tilts inhibitory TIGIT/CD155 interactions toward activation via downstream synNotch signaling. Usurping activities of TIGIT and CD73 promotes the function of adoptively transferred NK cells into intracranial patient-derived models of glioblastoma and enhances their natural cytolytic functions against this tumor to result in complete tumor eradication. In addition, targeting both receptors, in turn, reprograms the glioblastoma microenvironment via the recruitment of T cells and the downregulation of M2 macrophages. This study demonstrates that TIGIT/CD155 and CD73 are targetable receptor partners in glioblastoma. Our data show that synNotch-engineered pluripotent stem cell-derived NK cells are not only effective mediators of anti-glioblastoma responses within the setting of CD73 and TIGIT/CD155 co-targeting, but represent a powerful allogeneic treatment option for this tumor."}

Here we show that capture and engulfment of cell associated antigens by tissue resident lung cDC1 is inhibited during progression of mouse lung tumors. Mechanistically, loss of phagocytosis is linked to tumor-mediated downregulation of the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4, that is highly expressed in normal lung resident cDC1. TIM4 receptor blockade and conditional cDC1 deletion impair activation of tumor specific CD8+ T cells and promote tumor progression. In human lung adenocarcinomas, TIM4 transcripts increase the prognostic value of a cDC1 signature and predict responses to PD-1 treatment. Thus, TIM4 on lung resident cDC1 contributes to immune surveillance and its expression is suppressed in advanced tumors."}

IFN\u03b3 signaling score\u00a0strongly correlates with venetoclax resistance\u00a0in\u00a0primary AML patient cells.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0IFN\u03b3 treatment of primary AML patient cells increased\u00a0venetoclax resistance.\u00a0Lastly, a parsimonious 47-gene IFN\u03b3 score demonstrates robust prognostic value.

Here, we develop a comprehensive risk score (CRS) that combines risk effects of EBV and human genetics for NPC risk stratification and validate this CRS within an independent, population-based dataset. Comparing the top decile with the bottom quintile of CRSs, the odds ratio of developing NPC is 21 (95% confidence interval: 12\u201337) in the validation dataset. When combining the top quintile of CRS with EBV serology tests currently used for NPC screening in southern China, the positive prediction value of screening increases from 4.70% (serology test alone) to 43.24% (CRS plus serology test). By identifying individuals at a monogenic level of NPC risk, this CRS approach provides opportunities for personalized risk prediction and population screening in endemic areas for the early diagnosis and secondary prevention of NPC."}

DeBerardinis", "Baran D. Sumer", "Jinming Gao"], "abstract": "Extracellular pH impacts many molecular, cellular and physiological processes, and hence is tightly regulated. Yet, in tumours, dysregulated cancer cell metabolism and poor vascular perfusion cause the tumour microenvironment to become acidic. Here by leveraging fluorescent pH nanoprobes with a transistor-like activation profile at a pH of 5.3, we show that, in cancer cells, hydronium ions are excreted into a small extracellular region. Such severely polarized acidity (pH <5.3) is primarily caused by the directional co-export of protons and lactate, as we show for a diverse panel of cancer cell types via the genetic knockout or inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters, and also via nanoprobe activation in multiple tumour models in mice. We also observed that such spot acidification in ex vivo stained snap-frozen human squamous cell carcinoma tissue correlated with the expression of monocarboxylate transporters and with the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells. Severely spatially polarized tumour acidity could be leveraged for cancer diagnosis and therapy."}

One such approach that is currently undergoing clinical testing is a therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine that uses two different viruses expressing the same tumor antigen to prime and boost anti-tumor immunity. By providing the additional advantage of directly killing cancer cells, oncolytic viruses (OVs) constitute ideal platforms for such treatment strategy. However, given that the targeted tumor antigen is encoded into the viral genomes, its production requires robust infection and therefore, the vaccination efficiency partially depends on the unpredictable and highly variable intrinsic sensitivity of each tumor to OV infection. In this study, we demonstrate that anti-cancer vaccination using OVs (Adenovirus (Ad), Maraba virus (MRB), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Vaccinia virus (VV)) co-administered with antigenic peptides is as efficient as antigen-engineered OVs and does not depend on viral replication. Our strategy is particularly attractive for personalized anti-cancer vaccines targeting patient-specific mutations. We suggest that the use of OVs as adjuvant platforms for therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination warrants testing for cancer treatment."}

Here, we analyze publicly available germline genetic metadata from 4,574 children with cancer [11 studies; 1,083 whole exome sequences (WES), 1,950 whole genome sequences (WGS), and 1,541 gene panel] and 141,456 adults [125,748 WES and 15,708 WGS]. We find that pediatric cancer predisposition syndrome (pCPS) genes [n\u2009=\u200985] are highly constrained, harboring only a quarter of the loss-of-function variants that would be expected. This strong indication of selective pressure on pCPS genes is found across multiple lines of germline genomics data from both pediatric and adult cohorts. For six genes [ELP1, GPR161, VHL and SDHA/B/C], a clear lack of mutational constraint calls the pediatric penetrance and/or severity of associated cancers into question. Conversely, out of 23 known pCPS genes associated with biallelic risk, two [9%, DIS3L2 and MSH2] show significant constraint, indicating that they may monoallelically increase childhood cancer risk. In summary, we show that population genetic data provide empirical evidence that heritable childhood cancer leads to natural selection powerful enough to have significantly impacted the present-day gene pool."}

Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) may contribute to treatment failure. However, the extent of ITH in SCLC is still largely unknown. Here, we subject 120 tumor samples from 40 stage I-III SCLC patients to multi-regional whole-exome sequencing. The most common mutant genes are TP53 (88%) and RB1 (72%). We observe a medium level of mutational heterogeneity (0.30, range 0.0~0.98) and tumor mutational burden (TMB, 10.2 mutations/Mb, range 1.1~51.7). Our SCLC samples also exhibit somatic copy number variation (CNV) across all patients, with an average CNV ITH of 0.49 (range 0.02~0.99). In terms of mutation distribution, ITH, TMB, mutation clusters, and gene signatures, patients with combined SCLC behave roughly the same way as patients with pure SCLC. This condition also exists in smoking patients and patients with EGFR mutations. A higher TMB per cluster is associated with better disease-free survival while single-nucleotide variant ITH is linked to worse overall survival, and therefore these features may be used as prognostic biomarkers for SCLC. Together, these findings demonstrate the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity of surgically resected SCLC and provide insights into resistance to treatment."}

Within these low-noise regions, we identify tissue- and cancer-specific genes, defined as \u201cdark channel biomarker\u201d (DCB) genes, that are recurrently detected in individuals with cancer. DCB levels in plasma correlate with tumor shedding rate and RNA expression in matched tissue, suggesting that DCBs with high expression in tumor tissue could enhance cancer detection in patients with low levels of circulating tumor DNA. Overall, cfRNA provides a unique opportunity to detect cancer, predict the tumor tissue of origin, and determine the cancer subtype."}

Here, we found that IFN-activated proinflammatory macrophages after neoadjuvant chemotherapy enhanced antitumor immunity but promoted cancer chemoresistance. Mechanistically, IFN induced expression of cytoplasmic long noncoding RNA IFN-responsive nuclear factor-\u03baB activator (IRENA) in macrophages, which triggered nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling via dimerizing protein kinase R and subsequently increased production of protumor inflammatory cytokines. By constructing macrophage-conditional IRENA-knockout mice, we found that targeting IRENA in IFN-activated macrophages abrogated their protumor effects, while retaining their capacity to enhance antitumor immunity. Clinically, IRENA expression in post-chemotherapy macrophages was associated with poor patient survival. These findings indicate that lncRNA can determine the dichotomy of inflammatory cells on cancer progression and antitumor immunity and suggest that targeting IRENA is an effective therapeutic strategy to reversing tumor-promoting inflammation."}

Self-fitted normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) parameter values were used to analyze the risk of RP. SCRs were evaluated using the preferred Schneider\u2019s parameterization risk models. The dosimetric parameter of the ipsilateral lung volume receiving 40\u2009Gy (IV40) was selected as the dominant risk factor for the RP NTCP model. The results showed that the risks of RP and NTCP, as well as that of SCR of the ipsilateral lung, were slightly lower than the values in patients treated with VMAT versus IMRT (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01).

We also perform transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing to identify distinguishing features, including assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and methyl sequencing. Genomic analysis reveals that the mutational signature differs among the histological types, suggesting that different carcinogenic factors drive each histology. From the ATAC-seq results, master transcription factors are identified for each histology. Furthermore, clear cell RCC is classified into three epi-subtypes, one of which expresses highly immune checkpoint molecules with frequent loss of chromosome 14q. These genomic and epigenomic features may lead to the development of effective therapeutic strategies for RCC."}

Propensity-score matching further confirmed that adjuvant TKIs treatment extended the DFS (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.024), but did not improve OS (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.40). Our analysis revealed that adjuvant EGFR TKIs treatment was beneficial for early-stage NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations after complete resection."}

Ko", "Jun Deng"], "abstract": "Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and family history are major associated risk factors for the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The objective of this study was to develop and validate a multi-parameterized artificial neural network based on available personal health information for early detection of NMSC with high sensitivity and specificity, even in the absence of known UVR exposure and family history. The 1997\u20132015 NHIS adult survey data used to train and validate our neural network (NN) comprised of 2,056 NMSC and 460,574 non-cancer cases. We extracted 13 parameters for our NN: gender, age, BMI, diabetic status, smoking status, emphysema, asthma, race, Hispanic ethnicity, hypertension, heart diseases, vigorous exercise habits, and history of stroke. This study yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.81 and 0.81 for training and validation, respectively. Our results (training sensitivity 88.5% and specificity 62.2%, validation sensitivity 86.2% and specificity 62.7%) were comparable to a previous study of basal and squamous cell carcinoma prediction that also included UVR exposure and family history information. These results indicate that our NN is robust enough to make predictions, suggesting that we have identified novel associations and potential predictive parameters of NMSC."}

Extended resection (including distal pancreasectomy and/or splenectomy), has been often indicated for the treatment for the splenic flexure cancer, because the lymphatic drainage at this site is poorly defined and assumed as heterogeneous. Between January 2006 and May 2016, 103 patients with splenic flexure colon cancer were enrolled in the study. We evaluated the clinicopathological findings and outcomes of all patients and associated them to the different surgical treatment. Out of 103 selected cases an extended right hemicolectomy was performed in 22 (21.4%) patients, an extended left hemicolectomy in 24 (23.3%) patients, a segmental resection of the splenic flexure in 57 (55.3%) patients; the combined resection of adjacent organs showing tumor adherence was carried out in 11 (10.7%) patients. The tumor infiltrated near organs (T4) in 5 patients. No significant differences in complications were found among the three groups. In all groups no differences were found in the total number of harvested lymphnodes. After a median follow-up of 42 months, 30 recurrences and 19 deaths occurred (12 for tumor progression). There was no difference in overall and progression free survival among the three different surgical treatments. According to our results, the partial resection of splenic flexure was not associated with a worse prognosis and it was leading for a satisfactory oncological outcome. It is our opinion that the extended surgery is seldomly indicated to cure splenic flexure cancer."}

McGrail", "Michal Zimmermann", "Katharina Schlacher", "Timothy A. Yap"], "abstract": "Pharmacological inhibition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein serine/threonine kinase (ATR; also known as FRAP-related protein (FRP1)) has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer treatment that exploits synthetic lethal interactions with proteins involved in DNA damage repair, overcomes resistance to other therapies and enhances antitumour immunity. Multiple novel, potent ATR inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials using biomarker-directed approaches and involving patients across a broad range of solid cancer types; some of these inhibitors have now entered phase III trials. Further insight into the complex interactions of ATR with other DNA replication stress response pathway components and with the immune system is necessary in order to optimally harness the potential of ATR inhibitors in the clinic and achieve hypomorphic targeting of the various ATR functions. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the diverse range of predictive biomarkers of response to ATR inhibitors and of the intraclass differences between these agents could help to refine trial design and patient selection strategies. Key challenges that remain in the clinical development of ATR inhibitors include the optimization of their therapeutic index and the development of rational combinations with these agents. In this Review, we detail the molecular mechanisms regulated by ATR and their clinical relevance, and discuss the challenges that must be addressed to extend the benefit of ATR inhibitors to a broad population of patients with cancer."}

They achieve this through TERT activation or alternative telomere lengthening associated with ATRX or DAXX loss. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we dissect whole-genome sequencing data of over 2500 matched tumor-control samples from 36 different tumor types aggregated within the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium to characterize the genomic footprints of these mechanisms. While the telomere content of tumors with ATRX or DAXX mutations (ATRX/DAXXtrunc) is increased, tumors with TERT modifications show a moderate decrease of telomere content. One quarter of all tumor samples contain somatic integrations of telomeric sequences into non-telomeric DNA. This fraction is increased to 80% prevalence in ATRX/DAXXtrunc tumors, which carry an aberrant telomere variant repeat (TVR) distribution as another genomic marker. The latter feature includes enrichment or depletion of the previously undescribed singleton TVRs TTCGGG and TTTGGG, respectively. Our systematic analysis provides new insight into the recurrent genomic alterations associated with telomere maintenance mechanisms in cancer."}

However, the LCP CNN score is based on a single timepoint that ignores longitudinal information when prior imaging studies are available. Clinically, IPNs are often followed over time and temporal trends in nodule size or morphology inform management. In this study we investigated whether the change in LCP CNN scores over time was different between benign and malignant nodules. This study used a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design. Subjects with incidentally or screening detected IPNs 6\u201330\u00a0mm in diameter with at least 3 consecutive CT scans prior to diagnosis (slice thickness\u2009\u2264\u20091.5\u00a0mm) with the same nodule present were included. Disease outcome was adjudicated by biopsy-proven malignancy, biopsy-proven benign disease and absence of growth on at least 2-year imaging follow-up. Lung nodules were analyzed using the Optellum LCP CNN model. Investigators performing image analysis were blinded to all clinical data. The LCP CNN score was determined for 48 benign and 32 malignant nodules. There was no significant difference in the initial LCP CNN score between benign and malignant nodules. Overall, the LCP CNN scores of benign nodules remained relatively stable over time while that of malignant nodules continued to increase over time. The difference in these two trends was statistically significant. We also developed a joint model that incorporates longitudinal LCP CNN scores to predict future probability of cancer. Malignant and benign nodules appear to have distinctive trends in LCP CNN score over time. This suggests that longitudinal modeling may improve radiomic prediction of lung cancer over current models. Additional studies are needed to validate these early findings."}

We recruited and grouped 144 RT-treated patients with brain tumors into the Low dose group (N\u2009=\u200972) and the High dose group (N\u2009=\u200972) according to the RT dose applied. Patient data were collected by using the HADS and QLQ-BN20 system for subsequent analysis and comparison. Our analysis showed no significant correlation between the RT doses and the clinicopathological characteristics. We found that a high dose of RT could aggravate cognitive impairment and deteriorate patient role functioning, indicated by a higher MMSE and worsened role functioning in the High dose group. However, the depression status, social functioning, and global health status were comparable between the High dose group and the Low dose group at Month 0 and Month 1, while being worsened in the High dose group at Month 3, indicating the potential long-term deterioration of depression status in brain tumor patients induced by high-dose RT. By comparing patient data at Month 0, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 9 after RT, we found that during RT treatment, RT at a high dose could aggravate cognitive impairment in the short term and lead to worsened patient role functioning, and even deteriorate the overall psychological health status of patients in the long term."}

We employed EuroFlow-NGF-based single-tube eight-color multiparameter flow cytometry (MM-flow) and established a new gating strategy (POEMS-flow) to detect the monoclonal PCs in POEMS syndrome, gating CD38 broadly from dim to bright and CD45 narrowly from negative to dim compared to MM-flow. MM-flow detected monoclonal PCs in 9/25 (36.0%) cases, including 2/2 immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)-negative cases (100%). However, POEMS-flow detected monoclonal PCs in 18/25 cases (72.0%), including 2/2 IFE-negative cases (100%). POEMS-flow detected monoclonal PCs with immunophenotypes of CD19\u2212 in 17/18 (94.4%). In six cases where post-treatment samples were available, the size of the clones was significantly reduced after the treatment (P\u2009=\u20090.031).

The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters, and lesion-to-spinal cord signal intensity ratio (LSR), were analyzed to compare the benign and malignant groups using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic analysis. The Dstar values observed in lung cancer were slightly lower than those observed in pulmonary benign lesions (28.164\u2009\u00b1\u200931.950 versus 32.917\u2009\u00b1\u200934.184; Z\u2009=\u2009-2.239, p\u2009=\u20090.025).

Respondents had a median age of 52\u00a0years and 13\u00a0years of surgical experience. Only 32% of respondents performed routinely preoperative laryngoscopy in all thyroidectomies and 19% in all parathyroidectomies. Seventy-five percent of respondents used the intermittent-IONM, and 9.7% used the continuous-IONM. All respondents identified recurrent laryngeal nerve during surgery, and 40% of surgeons routinely identified external branch superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) during thyroidectomy. Seventy-eight percent of respondents used IONM always for all thyroidectomies. Only 11% stimulated EBSLN in all cases. Forty-nine percent used IONM always for all parathyroidectomies. The most frequent reasons for not using IONM were the unavailability of IONM, the high cost, and the lack of adding value to their clinical practice. Almost 10% declared not having IONM. The IONM is a reality in Spain, especially the intermittent mode. Its use is superior in thyroid surgery than in parathyroid. Its standardized use is not yet fully established, and routine adherence to standardized guidelines should increase."}

We previously generated an EGFR/HER2 targeted conjugate, dual-targeting ligand-based lidamycin (DTLL), which shows a highly potent antitumor effect. To overcome chemoresistance in PDAC, we aim to study DTLL efficacy when combined with gemcitabine and explore its mechanisms of action. DTLL in combination with gemcitabine show a superior inhibitory effect on the growth of gemcitabine-resistant/sensitive tumors. DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy via distinct action mechanisms mediated by mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4). It not only prevents neoplastic proliferation via ATK/mTOR blockade and NF-\u03baB impaired function in SMAD4-sufficient PDACs, but also restores SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling in SMAD4-deficient tumors and to overcome chemoresistance. DTLL seems to act as a SMAD4 module that normalizes its function in PDAC, having a synergistic effect in combination with gemcitabine. Our findings provide insight into a rational SMAD4-directed precision therapy in PDAC."}

Therefore, many studies have focused on the decrease of tumor\u2019s lactate as a novel cancer treatment. In the present study for the first time, a strictly anaerobic lactate-fermenting bacterium, Veillonella parvula, was employed for the decrease of tumor\u2019s lactate level. At first, 4T1 breast tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were administered with 106 V. parvula bacteria intravenously, orally, intraperitoneally, and intratumorally. Then, the bacteria biodistribution was evaluated. The best administration route according to tumor colonization was selected and its safety was assessed. Then, the therapeutic effect of V. parvula administration through the best route was investigated according to 4T1 murine breast tumor\u2019s growth and metastasis in vivo. In addition, histopathological and immunohistochemistry evaluations were done to estimate microscopic changes at the inner of the tumor and tumor\u2019s lactate level was measured after V. parvula administration. V. parvula exhibited considerable tumor-targeting and colonization efficacy, 24\u00a0h after intravenous administration. Normal organs were free of the bacteria after 72\u00a0h and no side effect was observed. Tumor colonization by V. parvula significantly decreased the tumors\u2019 lactate level for about 46% in comparison with control tumors which caused 44.3% and 51.6% decline (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the mean tumors\u2019 volume and liver metastasis of the treatment group in comparison with the control group, respectively. The treatment group exhibited 35% inhibition in the cancer cell proliferation in comparison with the control according to the Ki-67 immunohistochemistry staining. Therefore, intravenous administration of V. parvula is a tumor-specific and safe treatment which can significantly inhibit tumors\u2019 growth and metastasis by decreasing the tumor lactate level."}

CD4+CXCL13+ T cells in LNMT are more likely to differentiate into an exhausted state. Interestingly, LAMP3+ dendritic cells in LNMT display lower T cell priming and activating ability than in PT. Additionally, we identify a subtype of PLA2G2A+ cancer-associated fibroblasts enriched in HER2+ breast cancer patients that promotes immune infiltration. We also show that the antigen-presentation pathway is downregulated in malignant cells of the metastatic lymph node. Altogether, we characterize the microenvironment of LNMT and PT, which may shed light on the individualized therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis."}

However, the regulation of Pax5 expression remains elusive. The adaptor Rack1 can interact with multiple transcription factors and modulate their activation and/or stability. However, its role in the transcriptional control of B-cell fates is largely unknown. Here, we show that CD19-driven Rack1 deficiency leads to pro-B accumulation and a simultaneous reduction in B cells at later developmental stages. The generation of bone marrow chimeras indicates a cell-intrinsic role of Rack1 in B-cell homeostasis. Moreover, Rack1 augments BCR and TLR signaling in mature B cells. On the basis of the aberrant expression of Pax5-regulated genes, including CD19, upon Rack1 deficiency, further exploration revealed that Rack1 maintains the protein level of Pax5 through direct interaction and consequently prevents Pax5 ubiquitination. Accordingly, Mb1-driven Rack1 deficiency almost completely blocks B-cell development at the pro-B-cell stage. Ectopic expression of Pax5 in Rack1-deficient pro-B cells partially rescues B-cell development. Thus, Rack1 regulates B-cell development and function through, at least partially, binding to and stabilizing Pax5."}

While several under-development approaches target immune-suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, there is less focus on improving T cell function. Here we show that inhibiting vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (VIP-R) signaling enhances anti-tumor immunity in murine PDAC models. In silico data mining and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors indicate overexpression of the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in human PDAC tumors. Elevated VIP levels are also present in PDAC patient plasma and supernatants of cultured PDAC cells. Furthermore, T cells up-regulate VIP receptors after activation, identifying the VIP signaling pathway as a potential target to enhance T cell function. In mouse PDAC models, VIP-R antagonist peptides synergize with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in improving T cell recruitment into the tumors, activation of tumor-antigen-specific T cells, and inhibition of T cell exhaustion. In contrast to the limited single-agent activity of anti-PD1 antibodies or VIP-R antagonist peptides, combining both therapies eliminate tumors in up to 40% of animals. Furthermore, tumor-free mice resist tumor re-challenge, indicating anti-cancer immunological memory generation. VIP-R signaling thus represents a tumor-protective immune-modulatory pathway that is targetable in PDAC."}

Molecular factors contributing to different recurrence risks (RRs) remain poorly defined. Here, we perform an integrative proteogenomic and metabolomic characterization of 102 Chinese PTC patients with different RRs. Genomic profiling reveals that mutations in MUC16 and TERT promoter as well as multiple gene fusions like NCOA4-RET are enriched by the high RR. Integrative multi-omics analyses further describe the multi-dimensional characteristics of PTC, especially in metabolism pathways, and delineate dominated molecular patterns of different RRs. Moreover, the PTC patients are clustered into four subtypes (CS1: low RR and BRAF-like; CS2: high RR and metabolism type, worst prognosis; CS3: high RR and immune type, better prognosis; CS4: high RR and BRAF-like) based on the omics data. Notably, the subtypes display significant differences considering BRAF and TERT promoter mutations, metabolism and immune pathway profiles, epithelial cell compositions, and various clinical factors (especially RRs and prognosis) as well as druggable targets. This study can provide insights into the complex molecular characteristics of PTC recurrences and help promote early diagnosis and precision treatment of recurrent PTC."}

Anti-tumor T cell responses critically depend on antigen presenting dendritic cells (DC), and enhancing mobilization, antigen loading and activation of these cells represent an attractive possibility to potentiate T cell based therapies. Here we show that expansion of DCs by Flt3L administration impacts in situ vaccination with oncolytic Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). Mechanistically, NDV activates DCs and sensitizes them to dying tumor cells through upregulation of dead-cell receptors and synergizes with Flt3L to promote anti-tumor CD8+ T cell cross-priming. In vivo, Flt3L-NDV in situ vaccination induces parallel amplification of virus- and tumor-specific T cells, including CD8+ T cells reactive to newly-described neoepitopes, promoting long-term tumor control. Cross-presenting conventional Type 1 DCs are indispensable for the anti-tumor, but not anti-viral, T cell response, and type I IFN-dependent CD4+ Th1 effector cells contribute to optimal anti-tumor immunity. These data demonstrate that mobilizing DCs to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation improves oncolytic virotherapy and that neoepitope-specific T cells can be induced without individualized, ex vivo manufactured vaccines."}

Two distinct retinoblastoma subtypes with different clinical behavior have been described based on gene expression and methylation profiling. Using consensus clustering of DNA methylation analysis from 61 retinoblastomas, we identify a MYCN-driven cluster of subtype 2 retinoblastomas characterized by DNA hypomethylation and high expression of genes involved in protein synthesis. Subtype 2 retinoblastomas outside the MYCN-driven cluster are characterized by high expression of genes from mesodermal development, including NKX2-5. Knockdown of MYCN expression in retinoblastoma cell models causes growth arrest and reactivates a subtype 1-specific photoreceptor signature. These molecular changes suggest that removing the driving force of MYCN oncogenic activity rescues molecular circuitry driving subtype 1 biology. The MYCN-RB gene signature generated from the cell models better identifies MYCN-driven retinoblastoma than MYCN amplification and can identify cases that may benefit from MYCN-targeted therapy. MYCN drives tumor progression in a molecularly defined retinoblastoma subgroup, and inhibiting MYCN activity could restore a more differentiated and less aggressive tumor biology."}

TDLNs+ have distinct pathomorphologic and tumor microenvironment (TME)-compositional patterns, which still need to be thoroughly investigated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Here, we enrolled 312 LUAD patients with TDLNs+ from our institution between 2015 and 2019. 3DHISTECH was used to scan all of the TDLNs+. Based on morphologic features, TDLNs+ patterns were classified as polarized-type or scattered-type, and TME-compositional patterns were classified as colloid-type, necrosis-type, specific-type, and common-type. Multivariate analysis revealed an increased risk of early recurrence associated with scattered-type (HR 2.37, 95% CI: 1.06\u20135.28), colloid-type (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.03\u20133.67), and necrosis-type (HR 2.21, 95% CI: 1.13\u20134.89). NanoString transcriptional analysis revealed an immunosuppression and vascular invasion hallmark in scattered and necrosis patterns and an immunoactivated hallmark in polarized and common patterns. According to imaging mass cytometry (IMC), the scattered and necrosis patterns revealed that germinal centers (GC) were compromised, GCB cell and T cell proliferation were deficient, tumor cells had the potential for proliferation, and the immune attack may be weaker. In this study, we present evidence that LUAD patients have distinct patterns and immune hallmarks of TDLNs+ related to their prognosis."}

In particular, three distinct deep learning architectures (nnUNet, PocketNet, Swin UNETR) were considered using data gathered from six geographically different institutions. A total of 819 T1-weighted MR images were gathered from both public and internal sources. Our experiments compared each architecture\u2019s testing performance when trained both intra-institutionally and inter-institutionally. Models trained using nnUNet and its PocketNet variant achieved mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficients>0.9 on both intra- and inter-institutional test set data. The performance of these models suggests that nnUNet and PocketNet liver segmentation models trained on a large and diverse collection of T1-weighted MR images would on average achieve good intra-institutional segmentation performance."}

Intercellular communication between fibroblasts and cancer cells using various soluble mediators has often been reported. In this study, we find that a zinc-transporter (ZIP1) positive tumour-associated fibroblast subset is enriched after chemotherapy and directly interconnects lung cancer cells with gap junctions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify several fibroblast subpopulations, among which Zip1+ fibroblasts are highly enriched in mouse lung tumours after doxorubicin treatment. ZIP1 expression on fibroblasts enhances gap junction formation in cancer cells by upregulating connexin-43. Acting as a Zn2+ reservoir, ZIP1+ fibroblasts absorb and transfer Zn2+ to cancer cells, leading to ABCB1-mediated chemoresistance. Clinically, ZIP1high stromal fibroblasts are also associated with chemoresistance in human lung cancers. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanism by which fibroblasts interact directly with tumour cells via gap junctions and contribute to chemoresistance in lung cancer."}

Here, we analyze a cohort of 96 glioblastoma patients with survival ranging from a few months to over 4 years. 46 tumors are analyzed by mass spectrometry-based spatially-resolved proteomics guided by mass spectrometry imaging. Integration of protein expression and clinical information highlights three molecular groups associated with immune, neurogenesis, and tumorigenesis signatures with high intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Furthermore, a set of proteins originating from reference and alternative ORFs is found to be statistically significant based on patient survival times. Among these proteins, a 5-protein signature is associated with survival. The expression of these 5 proteins is validated by immunofluorescence on an additional cohort of 50 patients. Overall, our work characterizes distinct molecular regions within glioblastoma tissues based on protein expression, which may help guide glioblastoma prognosis and improve current glioblastoma classification."}

We demonstrated recipient anti-CAR T-cell responses against a murine single-chain variable fragment (scFv) used clinically in anti-BCMA CARs. To bypass potential anti-CAR immunogenicity and to reduce CAR binding domain size, here we designed CARs with antigen-recognition domains consisting of only a fully human heavy-chain variable domain without a light-chain domain. A CAR designated FHVH33-CD8BBZ contains a fully human heavy-chain variable domain (FHVH) plus 4-1BB and CD3\u03b6 domains. T cells expressing FHVH33-CD8BBZ exhibit similar cytokine release, degranulation, and mouse tumor eradication as a CAR that is identical except for substitution of a scFv for FHVH33. Inclusion of 4-1BB is critical for reducing activation-induced cell death and promoting survival of T cells expressing FHVH33-containing CARs. Our results indicate that heavy-chain-only anti-BCMA CARs are suitable for evaluation in a clinical trial."}

Here, we report that CD47-mediated anti-phagocytosis is concurrently upregulated with HER2 in radioresistant breast cancer (BC) cells and RT-treated mouse syngeneic BC. Co-expression of both receptors is more frequently detected in recurrent BC patients with poor prognosis. CD47 is upregulated preferentially in HER2-expressing cells, and blocking CD47 or HER2 reduces both receptors with diminished clonogenicity and augmented phagocytosis. CRISPR-mediated CD47 and HER2 dual knockouts not only inhibit clonogenicity but also enhance macrophage-mediated attack. Dual antibody of both receptors synergizes with\u00a0RT in control of syngeneic mouse breast tumor. These results provide the evidence that aggressive behavior of radioresistant BC is caused by CD47-mediated anti-phagocytosis conjugated with HER2-prompted proliferation. Dual blockade of CD47 and HER2 is suggested to eliminate resistant cancer cells in BC radiotherapy."}

Herein, based on long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling induced by active AKT, we identify that VAL (Vimentin associated lncRNA, LINC01546), which is directly induced by AKT/STAT3 signaling, functions as a potent pro-metastatic molecule and is essential for active AKT-induced tumor invasion, metastasis and anoikis resistance in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). Impressively, chemosynthetic siRNAs against VAL shows great therapeutic potential in AKT overactivation-driven metastasis. Interestingly, similar to activated AKT in LAD cells, although unable to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), VAL exerts potent pro-invasive and pro-metastatic effects through directly binding to Vimentin and competitively abrogating Trim16-depedent Vimentin polyubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, our study provides an interesting demonstration of a lncRNA-mediated mechanism for active AKT-driven EMT-independent LAD metastasis and indicates the great potential of targeting VAL or Vimentin stability as a therapeutic approach."}

Elevated CD73 levels in tumor tissues correlate with poor clinical outcomes. However, the crucial source of CD73 activity within the tumor microenvironment remains unspecified. Here, we demonstrate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute the prominent CD73hi population in human colorectal cancers (CRCs) and two CD73\u2212 murine tumor models, including a modified CRC. Clinically, high CAF abundancy in CRC tissues correlates strongly with elevated CD73 activity and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, CAF-CD73 expression is enhanced via an ADO-A2B receptor-mediated feedforward circuit triggered by tumor cell death, which enforces the CD73-checkpoint. Simultaneous inhibition of A2A and A2B pathways with CD73-neutralization synergistically enhances antitumor immunity in CAF-rich tumors. Therefore, the strategic and effective targeting of both the A2B-mediated ADO-CAF-CD73 feedforward circuit and A2A-mediated immune suppression is crucial for improving therapeutic outcomes."}

These tumors are defined by recurrent mutations in the IDH genes and other genetic alterations including inactivation of CDKN2A and COL2A1; however, these have no clinical value. Here we use multi-omics molecular profiles from a series of cartilage tumors and find an mRNA classification that identifies two subtypes of chondrosarcomas defined by a balance in tumor differentiation and cell cycle activation. The microRNA classification reveals the importance of the loss of expression of the 14q32 locus in defining the level of malignancy. Finally, DNA methylation is associated with IDH mutations. We can use the multi-omics classifications to predict outcome. We propose an mRNA-only classifier to reproduce the integrated multi-omics classification, and its application to relapsed tumor samples shows the progressive nature of the classification. Thus, it may be possible to use mRNA-based signatures to detect patients with high-risk chondrosarcomas."}

Here, we verify that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher PD-L1 expression than other subtypes. We then discover that nucleophosmin (NPM1) binds to PD-L1 promoter specifically in TNBC cells and activates PD-L1 transcription, thus inhibiting T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PARP1 suppresses PD-L1 transcription through its interaction with the nucleic acid binding domain of NPM1, which is required for the binding of NPM1 at PD-L1 promoter. Consistently, the PARP1 inhibitor olaparib elevates PD-L1 expression in TNBC and exerts a better effect with anti-PD-L1 therapy.

Here we adapt the HyperTRIBE method using an RBP fused to a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme (ADAR) to globally map the mRNA targets of the RBP MSI2 in mammalian adult normal and malignant stem cells. We reveal a unique MUSASHI-2 (MSI2) mRNA binding network in hematopoietic stem cells that changes during transition to multipotent progenitors. Additionally, we discover a significant increase in RNA binding activity of MSI2 in leukemic stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in selective regulation of MSI2\u2019s oncogenic targets. This provides a basis for MSI2 increased dependency in leukemia cells compared to normal cells. Moreover, our study provides a way to measure RBP function in rare cells and suggests that RBPs can achieve differential binding activity during cell state transition independent of gene expression."}

Here we analyze the response of a child with refractory bone marrow metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma to autologous HER2 CAR T cells. Three cycles of HER2 CAR T cells given after lymphodepleting chemotherapy induces remission which is consolidated with four more CAR T-cell infusions without lymphodepletion. Longitudinal immune-monitoring reveals remodeling of the T-cell receptor repertoire with immunodominant clones and serum autoantibodies reactive to oncogenic signaling pathway proteins. The disease relapses in the bone marrow at six months off-therapy. A second remission is achieved after one cycle of lymphodepletion and HER2 CAR T cells. Response consolidation with additional CAR T-cell infusions includes pembrolizumab to improve their efficacy. The patient described here is a participant in an ongoing phase I trial (NCT00902044; active, not recruiting), and is 20 months off T-cell infusions with no detectable disease at the time of this report."}

The advancement of UTUC research is hampered by the lack of disease-specific models. Here, we report the establishment of patient derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line models that reflect the genomic and biological heterogeneity of the human disease. Models demonstrate high genomic concordance with the corresponding patient tumors, with invasive tumors more likely to successfully engraft. Treatment of PDX models with chemotherapy recapitulates responses observed in patients. Analysis of a HER2 S310F-mutant PDX suggests that an antibody drug conjugate targeting HER2 would have superior efficacy versus selective HER2 kinase inhibitors. In sum, the biological and phenotypic concordance between patient and PDXs suggest that these models could facilitate studies of intrinsic and acquired resistance and the development of personalized medicine strategies for UTUC patients."}

In contrast, targeting tumor associated antigens is effective, however the identification of these antigens remains challenging. Here, we describe ExtraCRAd, a multi-vaccination strategy focused on an oncolytic virus artificially wrapped with tumor cancer membranes carrying tumor antigens. We demonstrate that ExtraCRAd displays increased infectivity and oncolytic effect in vitro and in vivo. We show that this nanoparticle platform controls the growth of aggressive melanoma and lung tumors in vivo both in preventive and therapeutic setting, creating a highly specific anti-cancer immune response. In conclusion, ExtraCRAd might serve as the next generation of personalized cancer vaccines with enhanced features over standard vaccination regimens, representing an alternative way to target cancer."}

However, cancer cells can evade phagocytosis by upregulating anti-phagocytosis molecule CD47. Here, we show that CD47 blockade alone is inefficient in stimulating glioma cell phagocytosis. However, combining CD47 blockade with temozolomide results in a significant pro-phagocytosis effect due to the latter\u2019s ability to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Increased tumour cell phagocytosis subsequently enhances antigen cross-presentation and activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase\u2013stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS\u2013STING) in APCs, resulting in more efficient T cell priming. This bridging of innate and adaptive responses inhibits glioma growth, but also activates immune checkpoint. Sequential administration of an anti-PD1 antibody overcomes this potential adaptive resistance. Together, these findings reveal a dynamic relationship between innate and adaptive immune regulation in tumours and support further investigation of phagocytosis modulation as a strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy responses."}

However, their potential ectopically colonization in the nasopharynx and impact on local cancer development remains uncertain. Our study involving paired nasopharyngeal-oral microbial samples from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients and controls unveils an aberrant oral-to-nasopharyngeal microbial translocation associated with increased NPC risk (OR\u2009=\u20094.51, P\u2009=\u20090.012). Thirteen species are classified as oral-translocated and enriched in NPC patients. Among these, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia are validated through culturomics and clonal strain identification. Nasopharyngeal biopsy meta-transcriptomes confirm these microbes within tumors, influencing local microenvironment and cytokine response. These microbes correlate significantly with the Epstein-Barr virus\u00a0(EBV) loads in the nasopharynx, exhibiting an increased dose-response relationship. Collectively, our study identifies oral microbes migrating to the nasopharynx, infiltrating tumors, impacting microenvironments and linking with EBV infection. These results enhance our understanding of abnormal microbial communication and their roles in carcinogenesis."}

The oncogenic MUC1-C protein is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and NEPC, but its specific role is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of MUC1-C in androgen-dependent PC cells suppresses androgen receptor (AR) axis signaling and induces the neural BRN2 transcription factor. MUC1-C activates a MYC\u2192BRN2 pathway in association with induction of MYCN, EZH2 and NE differentiation markers (ASCL1, AURKA and SYP) linked to NEPC progression. Moreover, MUC1-C suppresses the p53 pathway, induces the Yamanaka pluripotency factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) and drives stemness. Targeting MUC1-C decreases PC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for CRPC and NEPC. In PC tissues, MUC1 expression associates with suppression of AR signaling and increases in BRN2 expression and NEPC score. These results highlight MUC1-C as a master effector of lineage plasticity driving progression to NEPC."}

Here we identify predictive markers of response, based on whole-genome DNA (n\u2009=\u200970) and RNA-sequencing (n\u2009=\u200941) of fresh metastatic biopsy samples, collected prior to treatment with pembrolizumab. We find that PD-L1 combined positivity score does not, whereas tumor mutational burden and APOBEC mutagenesis modestly predict response. In contrast, T cell-to-stroma enrichment (TSE) score, computed from gene expression signature data to capture the relative abundance of T cells and stromal cells, predicts response to immunotherapy with high accuracy. Patients with a positive and negative TSE score show progression free survival rates at 6 months of 67 and 0%, respectively. The abundance of T cells and stromal cells, as reflected by the TSE score is confirmed by immunofluorescence in tumor tissue, and its good performance in two independent ICI-treated cohorts of patients with mUC (IMvigor210) and muscle-invasive UC (ABACUS) validate the predictive power of the TSE score. In conclusion, the TSE score represents a clinically applicable metric that potentially supports the prospective selection of patients with mUC for ICI treatment."}

However, most patients eventually develop Enz resistance that may involve inducing the\u00a0androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant 7 (ARv7). Here we report that high expression of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is associated with positive ARv7 detection in CRPC patients following Enz treatment. Targeting MAO-A with phenelzine or clorgyline, the FDA-approved drugs for antidepression, resensitize the Enz resistant (EnzR) cells to Enz treatment and further suppress EnzR cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that Enz-increased ARv7 expression can transcriptionally enhance MAO-A expression resulting in Enz resistance via altering the hypoxia HIF-1\u03b1 signals. Together, our results show that targeting the Enz/ARv7/MAO-A signaling with the antidepressants phenelzine or clorgyline can restore Enz sensitivity to suppress EnzR cell growth, which may indicate that these antidepression drugs can overcome the Enz resistance to further suppress the EnzR CRPC."}

Limited information is currently available on the mechanisms underlying the initial survival of tumor cells against alectinib. Using patient-derived cell line models, we herein demonstrate that cancer cells survive a treatment with alectinib by activating Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), which mediates the expression of the anti-apoptosis factors Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, and combinatorial inhibition against both YAP1 and ALK provides a longer tumor remission in ALK-rearranged xenografts when compared with alectinib monotherapy. These results suggest that the inhibition of YAP1 is a candidate for combinatorial therapy with ALK inhibitors to achieve complete remission in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer."}

Although heritable genetics is a significant risk factor, specific genetic variations and gene targets causally associated with UF are poorly understood. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on existing fibroid genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and integrated the identified risk loci and potentially causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with epigenomics, transcriptomics, 3D chromatin organization from diverse cell types as well as primary UF patient\u2019s samples. This integrative analysis identifies 24 UF-associated risk loci that potentially target 394 genes, of which 168 are differentially expressed in UF tumors. Critically, integrating this data with single-cell gene expression data from UF patients reveales the causal cell types with aberrant expression of these target genes. Lastly, CRISPR-based epigenetic repression (dCas9-KRAB) or activation (dCas9-p300) in a UF disease-relevant cell type further refines and narrows down the potential gene targets. Our findings and the methodological approach indicate the effectiveness of integrating multi-omics data with locus-specific epigenetic editing approaches for identifying gene- and celt type-targets of disease-relevant risk loci."}

Here, we identify, via two in vitro genome-wide CRISPR screens probing Daratumumab resistance, KDM6A as an important regulator of sensitivity to Daratumumab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Loss of KDM6A leads to increased levels of H3K27me3 on the promoter of CD38, resulting in a marked downregulation in CD38 expression, which may cause resistance to Daratumumab-mediated ADCC. Re-introducing CD38 does not reverse Daratumumab-mediated ADCC fully, which suggests that additional KDM6A targets, including CD48 which is also downregulated upon KDM6A loss, contribute to Daratumumab-mediated ADCC. Inhibition of H3K27me3 with an EZH2 inhibitor resulted in CD38 and CD48 upregulation and restored sensitivity to Daratumumab. These findings suggest KDM6A loss as a mechanism of Daratumumab resistance and lay down the proof of principle for the therapeutic application of EZH2 inhibitors, one of which is already FDA-approved, in improving MM responsiveness to Daratumumab."}

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Kaiser score for suspicious architectural distortions observed on mammography and compare it with the BI-RADS score of the lesion. Mammograms performed between January 2013 and March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of suspicious architectural distortion. Forty-one patients, who had at least 1\u00a0year of radiological follow-up or pathology results, and underwent breast MRI, were included in the study. Mammography findings and the BI-RADS category of the lesion were assessed. MRI findings were evaluated and Kaiser scoring was performed according to the tree flowchart. Ninety-one percent of the enhanced lesions had a Kaiser score of 5 and above. In the diagnosis of malignancy, the Kaiser score yielded an accuracy of 75.61% (AUC 0.833). A statistically significant correlation was observed indicating that a malignant diagnosis was more prevalent in patients with a Kaiser score of 5 and above (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally statistically significant relationship was also observed between the BI-RADS category of architectural distortions on mammography and the Kaiser score (p\u2009=\u20090.007).

We investigated the genetic mutations involved and the predictive biomarkers. Fourteen patients with SCC arising from IP and six patients with IPs without malignant transformation (sIP) were included. DNA was extracted separately from areas of normal tissue, IP, dysplasia, and SCC. Whole exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry was performed. Major oncogenic mutations were observed in the progression from IP to SCC. The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (39%) and CDKN2A (27%). Mutations in TP53 and/or CDKN2A were observed in three of six IPs with malignant transformation (cIP); none were observed in sIPs. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) increased from IP to SCC (0.64/Mb, 1.11/Mb, and 1.25 for IP, dysplasia, and SCC, respectively). TMB was higher in the cIPs than in the sIPs (0.64/Mb vs 0.3/Mb). Three cIPs showed a diffuse strong or null pattern in p53, and one showed a total loss of p16, a distinct pattern from sIPs. Our result suggests that TP53 and CDKN2A status can be predictive markers of malignant transformation of IP. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of p53 and p16 expression can be surrogate markers for TP53 and CDKN2A status."}

Improved detection and assessment of ICANS could improve management and allow greater utilization of CAR-T cell therapy, however, an objective, specific biomarker has not been identified. We hypothesized that the severity of ICANS can be quantified based on patterns of abnormal brain activity seen in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We conducted a retrospective observational study of 120 CAR-T cell therapy patients who had received EEG monitoring. We determined a daily ICANS grade for each patient through chart review. We used visually assessed EEG features and machine learning techniques to develop the Visual EEG-Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (VE-ICANS) score and assessed the association between VE-ICANS and ICANS. We also used it to determine the significance and relative importance of the EEG features. We developed the Visual EEG-ICANS (VE-ICANS) grading scale, a grading scale with a physiological basis that has a strong correlation to ICANS severity (R\u2009=\u20090.58 [0.47\u20130.66]) and excellent discrimination measured via area under the receiver operator curve (AUC\u2009=\u20090.91 for ICANS\u2009\u2265\u20092). This scale shows promise as a biomarker for ICANS which could help to improve clinical care through greater accuracy in assessing ICANS severity."}

Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated the exquisite molecular complexity of this tumor, but have not sufficiently defined the underlying mechanisms or identified promising therapeutic targets. To systematically explore RNA-protein interactions relevant to OS, we define the RNA interactomes together with the full proteome and the transcriptome of cells from five malignant bone tumors (four osteosarcomata and one malignant giant cell tumor of the bone) and from normal mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. These analyses uncover both systematic changes of the RNA-binding activities of defined RNA-binding proteins common to all osteosarcomata and individual alterations that are observed in only a subset of tumors. Functional analyses reveal a particular vulnerability of these tumors to translation inhibition and a positive feedback loop involving the RBP IGF2BP3 and the transcription factor Myc which affects cellular translation and OS cell viability. Our results thus\u00a0provide\u00a0insight into potentially clinically relevant RNA-binding protein-dependent mechanisms of osteosarcoma."}

However, thorough investigations into a robust breast cancer outcome-predicting model and its biological significance remain limited. This study develops a robust radiomic model for prognosis prediction, and further excavates its biological foundation and transferring prediction performance. We retrospectively collected preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data from three distinct breast cancer patient cohorts. In FUSCC cohort (n\u2009=\u2009466), Lasso was used to select features correlated with patient prognosis and multivariate Cox regression was utilized to integrate these features and build the radiomic risk model, while multiomic analysis was conducted to investigate the model\u2019s biological implications. DUKE cohort (n\u2009=\u2009619) and I-SPY1 cohort (n\u2009=\u2009128) were used to test the performance of the radiomic signature in outcome prediction. A thirteen-feature radiomic signature was identified in the FUSCC cohort training set and validated in the FUSCC cohort testing set, DUKE cohort and I-SPY1 cohort for predicting relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (RFS: p\u2009=\u20090.013, p\u2009=\u20090.024 and p\u2009=\u20090.035; OS: p\u2009=\u20090.036, p\u2009=\u20090.005 and p\u2009=\u20090.027 in the three cohorts).

However, MSI status is not routinely tested in prostate cancer, in part due to low prevalence and assay cost. As such, prediction of MSI status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) could identify prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from confirmatory testing to evaluate their eligibility for immunotherapy and need for Lynch syndrome testing. Prostate biopsies and surgical resections from prostate cancer patients referred to our institution were analyzed. MSI status was determined by next-generation sequencing. Patients sequenced before a cutoff date formed an algorithm development set (n\u2009=\u20094015, MSI-H 1.8%) and a paired validation set (n\u2009=\u2009173, MSI-H 19.7%) that consisted of two serial sections from each sample, one stained and scanned internally and the other at an external site. Patients sequenced after the cutoff date formed a temporally independent validation set (n\u2009=\u20091350, MSI-H 2.3%). Attention-based multiple instance learning models were trained to predict MSI-H from H&E WSIs. The predictor achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.78 (95% CI [0.69\u20130.86]), 0.72 (95% CI [0.63\u20130.81]), and 0.72 (95% CI [0.62\u20130.82]) on the internally prepared, externally prepared, and temporal validation sets, respectively, showing effective predictability and generalization to both external staining/scanning processes and temporally independent samples.

Here we demonstrate that SNS-101, a newly developed pH-selective VISTA antibody, addresses these challenges. Structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the pH-selectivity and unique epitope targeted by SNS-101. These properties confer favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles on SNS-101. In syngeneic tumor models utilizing human VISTA knock-in mice, SNS-101 shows in vivo efficacy when combined with a PD-1 inhibitor, modulates cytokine and chemokine signaling, and alters the tumor microenvironment. In summary, SNS-101, currently in Phase I clinical trials, emerges as a promising therapeutic biologic for a wide range of patients whose cancer is refractory to current immunotherapy regimens."}

Using an established mouse model of lung cancer, we find that cachexia is characterized by reduced food intake, spontaneous activity, and energy expenditure accompanied by muscle metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We identify Activin A as a purported driver of cachexia and treat with ActRIIB-Fc, a decoy ligand for TGF-\u03b2/activin family members, together with anamorelin (Ana), a ghrelin receptor agonist, to reverse muscle dysfunction and anorexia, respectively. Ana effectively increases food intake but only the combination of drugs increases lean mass, restores spontaneous activity, and improves overall survival. These beneficial effects are limited to female mice and are dependent on ovarian function. In agreement, high expression of Activin A in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with unfavorable prognosis only in female patients, despite similar expression levels in both sexes.

We identify 10 spatially-organized FAP+ CAF-related cellular niches, called EcoCellTypes, which are differentially localized within tumors. Consistent with their spatial organization, cancer cells drive the transition of detoxification-associated iCAF (Detox-iCAF) towards immunosuppressive extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myCAF (ECM-myCAF) via a DPP4- and YAP-dependent mechanism. In turn, ECM-myCAF polarize TREM2+ macrophages, regulatory NK and T cells to induce immunosuppressive EcoCellTypes, while Detox-iCAF are associated with FOLR2+ macrophages in an immuno-protective EcoCellType. FAP+ CAF subpopulations accumulate differently according to the invasive BC status and predict invasive recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which could help in identifying low-risk DCIS patients eligible for therapeutic de-escalation."}

{"title": "Gut microbiota in colorectal cancer development and therapy", "published": "11 May 2023", "authors": ["Chi Chun Wong", "Jun Yu"], "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the commonest cancers globally. A unique aspect of CRC is its intimate association with the gut microbiota, which forms an essential part of the tumour microenvironment. Research over the past decade has established that dysbiosis of gut bacteria, fungi, viruses and Archaea accompanies colorectal tumorigenesis, and these changes might be causative. Data from mechanistic studies demonstrate the ability of the gut microbiota to interact with the colonic epithelia and immune cells of the host via the release of a diverse range of metabolites, proteins and macromolecules that regulate CRC development. Preclinical and some clinical evidence also underscores the role of the gut microbiota in modifying the therapeutic responses of patients with CRC to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in CRC and outline the potential translational and clinical implications for CRC diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Emphasis is placed on how the gut microbiota could now be better harnessed by developing targeted microbial therapeutics as chemopreventive agents against colorectal tumorigenesis, as adjuvants for chemotherapy and immunotherapy to boost drug efficacy and safety, and as non-invasive biomarkers for CRC screening and patient stratification. Finally, we highlight the hurdles and potential solutions to translating our knowledge of the gut microbiota into clinical practice."}

Patients often experience several response-relapse events, until tumors become resistant and life expectancy drops to 12\u201315 months. Despite improved knowledge of the molecular determinants of platinum resistance, the lack of clinical applicability limits exploitation of many potential targets, leaving patients with limited options. Serine biosynthesis has been linked to cancer growth and poor prognosis in various cancer types, however its role in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is not known. Here, we show that a subgroup of resistant tumors decreases phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) expression at relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we observe that this phenomenon is accompanied by a specific oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regenerating phenotype, which helps tumor cells in sustaining Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity under platinum treatment.

Patients with N3 nasopharyngeal carcinoma have a high risk of distant metastasis, however, if the addition of immunotherapy to standard treatment could improve efficacy is unclear. In this phase II clinical trial (ChiCTR2000032317), 49 patients with stage TanyN3M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled and received the combination of three cycles of induction chemotherapy, camrelizumab and apatinib followed by chemoradiotherapy. Here we report on the primary outcome of distant metastasis-free survival and secondary end points of objective response rate, failure-free survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, overall survival and toxicity profile. After induction therapy, all patients had objective response, including 13 patients (26.5%) with complete response. After a median follow-up of 28.7 months, the primary endpoint of 1-year distant metastasis-free survival was met for the cohort (1-year DMFS rate: 98%). Grade\u22653 toxicity appeared in 32 (65.3%) patients, with the most common being mucositis (14[28.6%]) and nausea/vomiting (9[18.4%]). In this work, camrelizumab and apatinib in combination with induction chemotherapy show promising distant metastasis control with acceptable safety profile in patients with stage TanyN3M0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma."}

Activating oncogenic mutations in KRAS and NRAS are common in CRC, driving tumor progression and influencing efficacy of both cytotoxic and targeted therapies. The RAS mutational spectrum differs substantially between tumors arising from distinct tissues. Structure-function analysis of relatively common somatic RAS mutations in G12, Q61, and other codons is characterized by differing potency and modes of action. Here we show the mutational profile of KRAS, NRAS, and the less common HRAS in 13,336 CRC tumors, comparing the frequency of specific mutations based on age of diagnosis, MSI status, and colon versus rectum subsite. We identify mutation hotspots, and unexpected differences in mutation spectrum, based on these clinical parameters."}

We find clonally expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the blood and tumor after pembrolizumab treatment, and this V\u03b32V\u03b41 clonotype recognizes Merkel cancer cells in a TCR-dependent manner. Notably, the intra-tumoral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the MCC patient are characterized by higher expression of PD-1 and TIGIT, relative to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells. Our results demonstrate that innate-like T cells could also contribute to an anti-tumor response after PD-1 blockade."}

Here, anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibodies (aPD-L1) are loaded into a redox-responsive micelle and the ICB efficacy is further amplified by paclitaxel (PTX)-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) via a co-encapsulation approach for the reinvigoration of local anti-GBM immune responses. Consequently, the micelles cross the BTB and are retained in the reductive tumor microenvironment without altering the bioactivity of aPD-L1. The ICB efficacy is enhanced by the aPD-L1 and PTX combination with suppression of primary and recurrent GBM, accumulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and induction of long-lasting immunological memory in the orthotopic GBM-bearing mice. The co-encapsulation approach facilitating efficient antibody delivery and combining with chemotherapeutic agent-induced ICD demonstrate that the chemo-immunotherapy might reprogram local immunity to empower immunotherapy against GBM."}

We identified enrichment for genomic aberrations of multiple negative regulators of the NF-\u03baB pathway, including CYLD, TRAF3, NFKBIA and NLRC5, in a total of 41% of cases. Functional analysis confirmed inactivating CYLD mutations as drivers for NPC cell growth. The EBV oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) functions to constitutively activate NF-\u03baB signalling, and we observed mutual exclusivity among tumours with somatic NF-\u03baB pathway aberrations and LMP1-overexpression, suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation is selected for by both somatic and viral events during NPC pathogenesis."}

Here, we show that resistant cells without the p.T790M or other acquired mutations are sensitive to the Aurora B (AURKB) inhibitors barasertib and S49076. Phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a major product of AURKB, is increased in most resistant cells and treatment with AURKB inhibitors reduces the levels of pH3, triggering G1/S arrest and polyploidy. Senescence is subsequently induced in cells with acquired mutations while, in their absence, polyploidy is followed by cell death. Finally, in NSCLC patients, pH3 levels are increased after progression on EGFR TKIs and high pH3 baseline correlates with shorter survival. Our results reveal that AURKB activation is associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, and that AURKB constitutes a potential target in NSCLC progressing to anti-EGFR therapy and not carrying resistance mutations."}

We hypothesize that cells harbouring spliceosome gene mutations have increased sensitivity to pharmacological perturbation of the spliceosome. We focus on mutant U2AF1 and utilize sudemycin compounds that modulate pre-mRNA splicing. We find that haematopoietic cells expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F), including primary patient cells, have an increased sensitivity to in vitro sudemycin treatment relative to controls. In vivo sudemycin treatment of U2AF1(S34F) transgenic mice alters splicing and reverts haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion induced by mutant U2AF1 expression. The splicing effects of sudemycin and U2AF1(S34F) can be cumulative in cells exposed to both perturbations\u2014drug and mutation\u2014compared with cells exposed to either alone. These cumulative effects may result in downstream phenotypic consequences in sudemycin-treated mutant cells. Taken together, these data suggest a potential for treating haematological cancers harbouring U2AF1 mutations with pre-mRNA splicing modulators like sudemycins."}

Herein, the skin-mountable electrostimulation-augmented photothermal patch (eT-patch) comprising transparent ionic gel with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) doping is developed and applied for the treatment of melanoma under photostimulation at 0.5\u2009W/cm2. The eT-patch designed has superior photothermal and electrical characteristics owing to ionic gels doped with MXene which provides high photothermal conversion efficiency and electrical conductivity as a medium. Simultaneously, the ionic gel-based eT-patch having excellent optical transparency actualizes real-time observation of skin response and melanoma treatment process under photothermal and electrical stimulation (PES) co-therapy. Systematical cellular study on anti-tumor mechanism of the eT-patch under PES treatment revealed that eT-patch under PES treatment can synergically trigger cancer cell apoptosis and pyroptosis, which together lead to the death of melanoma cells. Due to the obvious advantages of relatively safe and less side effects in healthy organs, the developed eT-patch provides a promising cost-effective therapeutic strategy for skin tumors and will open a new avenue for biomedical applications of ionic gels."}

Crizotinib, an ALK/ROS1/MET inhibitor, is highly effective against ROS1-rearranged lung cancer and is used in clinic. However, crizotinib resistance is an emerging issue, and several resistance mechanisms, such as secondary kinase-domain mutations (e.g., ROS1-G2032R) have been identified in crizotinib-refractory patients. Here we characterize a new selective ROS1/NTRK inhibitor, DS-6051b, in preclinical models of ROS1- or NTRK-rearranged cancers. DS-6051b induces dramatic growth inhibition of both wild type and G2032R mutant ROS1\u2013rearranged cancers or NTRK-rearranged cancers in vitro and in vivo. Here we report that DS-6051b is effective in treating ROS1- or NTRK-rearranged cancer in preclinical models, including crizotinib-resistant ROS1 positive cancer with secondary kinase domain mutations especially G2032R mutation which is highly resistant to crizotinib as well as lorlatinib and entrectinib, next generation ROS1 inhibitors."}

Identification of effective strategies to target PTCL biology represents an urgent need. Here we report that PTCL are sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, and, in particular, to THZ1, a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). The STAT-signalling pathway is highly vulnerable to THZ1 even in PTCL cells that carry the activating STAT3 mutation Y640F. In mutant cells, CDK7 inhibition decreases STAT3 chromatin binding and expression of highly transcribed target genes like MYC, PIM1, MCL1, CD30, IL2RA, CDC25A and IL4R. In surviving cells, THZ1 decreases the expression of STAT-regulated anti-apoptotic BH3 family members MCL1 and BCL-XL sensitizing PTCL cells to BH3 mimetic drugs. Accordingly, the combination of THZ1 and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax improves lymphoma growth control in a primary PTCL ex vivo culture and in two STAT3-mutant PTCL xenografts, delineating a potential targeted agent-based therapeutic option for these patients."}

Here we found that lncRNA-p21 is highly expressed in the NEPC patients derived xenograft tissues (NEPC-PDX). Results from cell lines and human clinical sample surveys also revealed that lncRNA-p21 expression is up-regulated in NEPC and Enz treatment could increase the lncRNA-p21 to induce the NED. Mechanism dissection revealed that Enz could promote the lncRNA-p21 transcription via altering the androgen receptor (AR) binding to different androgen-response-elements, which switch the EZH2 function from histone-methyltransferase to non-histone methyltransferase, consequently methylating the STAT3 to promote the NED. Preclinical studies using the PDX mouse model proved that EZH2 inhibitor could block the Enz-induced NED. Together, these results suggest targeting the Enz/AR/lncRNA-p21/EZH2/STAT3 signaling may help urologists to develop a treatment for\u00a0better suppression of the human CRPC progression."}

Herein, we demonstrate effective immunotherapy of colorectal cancer via systemic delivery of an immunostimulatory chemotherapeutic combination in nanoscale coordination polymer (NCP) core-shell particles. Oxaliplatin and dihydroartemesinin have contrasting physicochemical properties but strong synergy in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and anticancer activity. The combined ROS generation is harnessed for immune activation to synergize with an anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of murine colorectal cancer tumours. The favourable biodistribution and tumour uptake of NCPs and the absence of peripheral neuropathy allow for repeated dosing to afford 100% tumour eradication. The involvement of innate and adaptive immune systems elicit strong and long lasting antitumour immunity which prevents tumour formation when cured mice are challenged with cancer cells. The intrinsically biodegradable, well tolerated, and systemically available immunostimulatory NCP promises to enter clinical testing as an immunotherapy against colorectal cancer."}

Here, we identify a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM)9 as a modulator of PDAC progression via stabilization of wild-type and mutant KRAS proteins. Mechanistically, ADAM9 loss increases the interaction of KRAS with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which functions as a selective autophagy receptor in conjunction with light chain 3 (LC3), triggering lysosomal degradation of KRAS. Suppression of ADAM9 by a small-molecule inhibitor restricts disease progression in spontaneous models, and combination with gemcitabine elicits dramatic regression of patient-derived tumors. Our findings provide a promising strategy to target the KRAS signaling cascade and demonstrate a potential modality to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy in PDAC."}

Primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, disease control rate, immune-related response criteria, and safety. The ORR was 30.4% and the trial met the pre-specified endpoint. The median PFS was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval: 5.7\u201310.4).

In this study, we conduct a retrospective comparison of the proteins secreted by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in responders and non-responders among a cohort of ten patients who received Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody). Our findings indicate that non-responders have a high abundance of secreted RNase1, which is associated with a poor prognosis in various cancer types. Furthermore, mice implanted with HCC cells that overexpress RNase1 exhibit immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and diminished response to anti-PD-1 therapy. RNase1 induces the polarization of macrophages towards a tumor growth-promoting phenotype through activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signaling pathway. Targeting the RNase1/ALK axis reprograms the macrophage polarization, with increased CD8+ T- and Th1- cell recruitment. Moreover, simultaneous targeting of the checkpoint protein PD-1 unleashes cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses. Treatment utilizing both an ALK inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 antibody exhibits enhanced tumor regression and facilitates long-term immunity. Our study elucidates the role of RNase1 in mediating tumor resistance to immunotherapy and reveals an RNase1-mediated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, highlighting the potential of targeting RNase1 as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy in HCC."}

B cell receptors (BCR) of mature lymphoid malignancies are exceptional in that they harbor tumor-specific-stereotyped sequences in the form of point mutations that drive self-engagement of the BCR and autologous signaling. Here, we use a BCR light chain neoepitope defined by a characteristic point mutation (IGLV3-21R110) for selective targeting of a poor-risk subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. We develop murine and humanized CAR constructs expressed in T cells from healthy donors and CLL patients that eradicate IGLV3-21R110 expressing cell lines and primary CLL cells, but neither cells expressing the non-pathogenic IGLV3-21G110 light chain nor polyclonal healthy B cells. In vivo experiments confirm epitope-selective cytolysis in xenograft models in female mice using engrafted IGLV3-21R110 expressing cell lines or primary CLL cells. We further demonstrate in two humanized mouse models lack of cytotoxicity towards human B cells. These data provide the basis for advanced approaches of resistance-preventive and biomarker-guided cellular targeting of functionally relevant lymphoma driver mutations sparing normal B cells."}

Here, we describe an integrative genomic and RNAi-based approach that identifies and validates gene addictions in TNBCs. CNAs and gene expression alterations are integrated and genes scored for pre-specified target features revealing 130 candidate genes. We test functional dependence on each of these genes using RNAi in breast cancer and non-malignant cells, validating malignant cell selective dependence upon 37 of 130 genes. Further analysis reveals a cluster of 13 TNBC addiction genes frequently co-upregulated that includes genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response, and malignant cell selective mitotic genes. We validate the mechanism of addiction to a potential drug target: the mitotic kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1/HSET), essential for successful bipolar division of centrosome-amplified malignant cells and develop a potential selection biomarker to identify patients with tumors exhibiting centrosome amplification."}

Here, we explored its efficacy and mechanism of cell death in melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that DDA induced lethal autophagy in vitro and in vivo, including primary AML patient samples, independently of melanoma Braf status or AML molecular and cytogenetic classifications. DDA is a partial agonist on liver-X-receptor (LXR) increasing Nur77, Nor1, and LC3 expression leading to autolysosome formation. Moreover, DDA inhibited the cholesterol biosynthesizing enzyme 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol-\u03948,7-isomerase (D8D7I) leading to sterol accumulation and cooperating in autophagy induction. This mechanism of death was not observed with other LXR ligands or D8D7I inhibitors establishing DDA selectivity. The potent anti-tumor activity of DDA, its original mechanism of action and its low toxicity support its clinical evaluation. More generally, this study reveals that DDA can direct control a nuclear receptor to trigger lethal autophagy in cancers."}

Here we report that there is also a gender difference between pulmonary metastasis and lymph node metastasis showing that the androgen receptor (AR)-positive ccRCC may prefer to metastasize to lung rather than to lymph nodes. A higher AR expression increases ccRCC hematogenous metastasis yet decreases ccRCC lymphatic metastases. Mechanism dissection indicates that AR enhances miR-185-5p expression via binding to the androgen response elements located on the promoter of miR-185-5p, which suppresses VEGF-C expression via binding to its 3\u2032 UTR. In contrast, AR-enhanced miR-185-5p also promotes HIF2\u03b1/VEGF-A expression via binding to the promoter region of HIF2\u03b1. Together, these results provide a unique mechanism by which AR can either increase or decrease ccRCC metastasis at different sites and may help us to develop combined therapies using anti-AR and anti-VEGF-C compounds to better suppress ccRCC progression."}

The complex interplay of the tumour microenvironment (TME) and the circulating immune response has proven to be challenging to decipher. MicroRNAs have gained increasing attention for their role in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, particularly because they can have immunomodulatory properties. We evaluated the presence of immune-specific extracellular vesicle (EV) microRNAs in the plasma of patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) prior to initiation of ICI. We found significantly lower levels of microRNA155-3p (miR155) in responders to ICI, when compared to non-responders. This microRNA has unique immunomodulatory properties, thus providing potential biological rationale for our findings. Our results support further work in exploring microRNAs as potential biomarkers of response to immunotherapy."}

A study involving 2023 participants conducted initial screenings, and positive cases underwent further tests, including ultrasound, mammography, and biopsy. SPSSv28 analysed collected data. Among 2023 subjects, 3 screened positive for breast lumps. Subsequent clinical examination and biopsy identified 1 normal case and 2 with breast cancer, resulting in a prevalence proportion of 0.0009 or 98 per 100,000. This study helps fill gap in breast cancer prevalence data for rural Rajasthan. The results highlight a concerning prevalence of breast cancer in the rural area near NIMS hospital, emphasizing the urgent need for increased awareness, early detection, and better healthcare access. Challenges like limited resources, awareness programs, and delayed diagnosis contribute to this high incidence. To address this, comprehensive approach is necessary, including improved screening programs and healthcare facilities in rural areas. Prioritizing rural healthcare and evidence-based strategies can reduce the burden of breast cancer and improve health outcomes."}

Bollard", "Brian R. Rood"], "abstract": "Neoantigen discovery in pediatric brain tumors is hampered by their low mutational burden and scant tissue availability. Here we develop a proteogenomic approach combining tumor DNA/RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics to identify tumor-restricted (neoantigen) peptides arising from multiple genomic aberrations to generate a highly target-specific, autologous, personalized T cell immunotherapy. Our data indicate that aberrant splice junctions are the primary source of neoantigens in medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor. Proteogenomically identified tumor-specific peptides are immunogenic and generate MHC II-based T cell responses. Moreover, polyclonal and polyfunctional T cells specific for tumor-specific peptides effectively eliminate tumor cells in vitro. Targeting tumor-specific antigens obviates the issue of central immune tolerance while potentially providing a safety margin favoring combination with other immune-activating therapies. These findings demonstrate the proteogenomic discovery of immunogenic tumor-specific peptides and lay the groundwork for personalized targeted T cell therapies for children with brain tumors."}

Yet several aspects underlying their dynamic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remain elusive, including the impact of distinct genetic mutations in shaping a cancer-permissive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, in newly generated, clinically-relevant somatic female HCC mouse models, we identify cancer genetics\u2019 specific and stage-dependent alterations of the liver TME associated with distinct histopathological and malignant HCC features. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated, NrasG12D-driven tumors exhibit a mixed phenotype of prominent inflammation and immunosuppression in a T cell-excluded TME. Mechanistically, we report a NrasG12D cancer cell-driven, MEK-ERK1/2-SP1-dependent GM-CSF secretion enabling the accumulation of immunosuppressive and proinflammatory monocyte-derived Ly6Clow cells. GM-CSF blockade curbs the accumulation of these cells, reduces inflammation, induces cancer cell death and prolongs animal survival. Furthermore, GM-CSF neutralization synergizes with a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor to restrain HCC outgrowth. These findings underscore the profound alterations of the myeloid TME consequential to MAPK pathway activation intensity and the potential of GM-CSF inhibition as a myeloid-centric therapy tailored to subsets of HCC patients."}

Twenty (16.1%) patients with GC developed postoperative liver dysfunction (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0\u2009\u2265\u2009Grade 3). Univariate analyses identified robotic surgery as a risk factor for postoperative liver dysfunction (P\u2009=\u20090.005). There was no correlation between the postoperative liver dysfunction status and postoperative complications or postoperative hospital stays. Patients with postoperative liver dysfunction did not have significantly worse overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.296) or recurrence-free survival (P\u2009=\u20090.565) than those without postoperative liver dysfunction. Robotic surgery is a risk factor for postoperative liver dysfunction; however, postoperative liver dysfunction does not affect short or long-term outcomes."}

We tried to provide evidence on the timing of the first cystoscopy after the initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-BT) for patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) using big data. This was a retrospective National Health Insurance Service database analysis. The following outcomes were considered: recurrence, progression, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. Exposure was the time-to-treatment initiation (TTI), a continuous variable representing the time to the first cystoscopy from the first TUR-BT within 1 year. Additionally, we categorized TTI (TTIc) into five levels:\u2009<\u20092, 2\u20134, 4\u20136, 6\u20138, and 8\u201312\u00a0months. A landmark time of 1\u00a0year after the initial TUR-BT was described to address immortal-time bias. We identified the optimal time for the first cystoscopy using Cox regression models with and without restricted cubic splines (RCS) for TTI and TTIc, respectively. Among 26,660 patients, 16,880 (63.3%) underwent cystoscopy within 2\u20134\u00a0months. A U-shaped trend of the lowest risks at TTI was observed in the 2\u20134\u00a0months group for progression, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality. TTI within 0\u20132\u00a0months had a higher risk of progression (aHR 1.36; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.15\u20131.60; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and cancer-specific mortality (aHR 1.29; 95% CI 1.05\u20131.58; p\u2009=\u20090.010). Similarly, TTI within 8\u201312\u00a0months had a higher risk of progression (aHR 2.09; 95% CI 1.67\u20132.63; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and cancer-specific mortality (aHR 1.96; 95% CI 1.48\u20132.60; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Based on the RCS models, the risks of progression, cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality were lowest at TTI of 4\u00a0months. The timing of the first cystoscopy follow-up was associated with oncologic prognosis. In our model, undergoing cystoscopy at 4\u00a0months has shown the best outcomes in clinical course. Therefore, patients who do not receive cystoscopy at approximately 4\u00a0months for any reason need more careful follow-up to predict a poor clinical course."}

The objective of this study was to identify molecular predictive factors for response to regorafenib using a clinically available platform. We analyzed a prospective cohort of 30 patients harboring recurrent glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, and treated with regorafenib. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues using a clinically available platform. Moreover, MGMT methylation and EGFRvIII expression analyses were performed. Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 30% and median overall survival (OS) was 7.5\u00a0months, in line with literature data. NGS analysis revealed a mutation in the EGFR pathway in 18% of cases and a mutation in the mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway in 18% of cases. In the remaining cases, no mutations were detected. Patients carrying MAPK pathway mutation had a poor response to regorafenib treatment, with a significantly shorter PFS and a nonsignificantly shorter OS compared to EGFR-mutated patients (for PFS, 2.5 vs 4.5\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.0061; for OS, 7 vs 9\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u20090.1076). Multivariate analysis confirmed that MAPK pathway mutations independently predicted a shorter PFS after regorafenib treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.0188). The negative prognostic role of MAPK pathway alteration was reinforced when we combined EGFR-mutated with EGFRvIII-positive cases. Recurrent glioblastoma tumors with an alteration in MAPK pathway could belong to the mesenchymal subtype and respond poorly to regorafenib treatment, while EGFR-altered cases have a better response to regorafenib. We thus provide a molecular selection criterion easy to implement in the clinical practice."}

Cardamonin, a principal compound derived from Myristica fragrans of the Zingiberaceae family, has garnered attention for its potential to suppress the onset and progression of various malignancies encompassing breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancers. Nevertheless, the involvement of cardamonin in the treatment of OSCC and its underlying mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. This research explored the possible target of cardamonin in treating OSCC via network pharmacological analysis. Subsequently, this research investigated the impact of cardamonin on OSCC cells via in vitro experiments, revealing its capacity to impede the migration, proliferation, and invasion of OSCC cells. Additionally, western blotting analysis demonstrated that cardamonin facilitates apoptosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway. The findings suggest that MMP9 and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may serve as the target and pathway of cardamonin in treating OSCC. To summarize, the research findings suggest that cardamonin may facilitate apoptosis in OSCC cells by inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway activation. These outcomes offer a theoretical basis for the utilization of cardamonin as a natural drug for treating OSCC."}

We identify specific patterns of PTEN mutation associated with microsatellite stability/instability (MSS/MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), patient age, and tumor location. Within groups separated by MSS/MSI status, this identifies distinct profiles of nucleotide hotspots, and suggests differing profiles of protein-damaging effects of mutations. Moreover, discrete categories of PTEN mutations display non-identical patterns of co-occurrence with mutations in other genes important in CRC pathogenesis, including KRAS, APC, TP53, and PIK3CA.

Here, using multi-region whole exome/T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry, we reveal a rather homogeneous mutational landscape but extremely cold and heterogeneous TCR repertoire in limited-stage SCLC tumors (LS-SCLCs). Compared to localized non-small cell lung cancers, LS-SCLCs have similar predicted neoantigen burden and genomic ITH, but significantly colder and more heterogeneous TCR repertoire associated with higher chromosomal copy\u00a0number aberration (CNA) burden. Furthermore, copy\u00a0number loss of IFN-\u03b3 pathway genes is frequently observed and positively correlates with CNA burden. Higher mutational burden, higher T cell infiltration and positive PD-L1 expression are associated with longer overall survival (OS), while higher CNA burden is associated with shorter OS in patients with LS-SCLC."}

This research aims to evaluate its potential role in inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and glycolysis and uncover its underlying molecular mechanism. We collected breast cancer tissue samples from eight patients between January 2019 and June 2023 in our Hospital to analyse CIAPIN1 expression. We transfected human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468) with siRNA of CIAPIN1. Finally, we determined protein expression using RT-qPCR and Western blotting. CIAPIN1 expression was elevated in both breast cancer tissue and serum. Overexpression of CIAPIN1 detected in the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-468. In addition, CIAPIN1 overexpression increased cell proliferation and migration rate. CIAPIN1 downregulation suppressed cell proliferation while elevated cellular apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress in breast cancer cells. Moreover, CIAPIN1 inhibition remarkably suppressed pyruvate, lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and reduced the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) protein expression and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in breast cancer cells. Downregulation of CIAPIN1 suppresses cell proliferation, migration and glycolysis capacity in breast cancer cells by inhibiting the STAT3/PKM2 pathway."}

Program flowchart is simple and current, indicating repetition of a negative test after five years. The first-round (October 2017-September 2022) screened 20,551 women by DNA-HPV testing with 58.7% coverage and 99.4% compliance with the program's targeted age range. Coverage increases to 77.8% when excluding the \u2018pandemic period\u2019. The DNA-HPV testing was 87.2% negative with 6.2% colposcopy referrals and 84.8% colposcopies performed. A total of 258 high-grade precursor lesions and 29 cervical cancers (mean age\u2009=\u200941.4\u00a0years, 83% Stage I) were detected. As a reference, 41,387 cytology tests from the previous program (2012\u20132016) detected 36 cervical cancers (mean age\u2009=\u200952.0\u00a0years, p\u2009=\u20090.0005), with 67% in advanced stages (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

To improve PDAC therapy, we establish screening systems based on organoid and co-culture technologies and find a payload of antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC), a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein degrader named EBET. We select CEACAM6/CD66c as an ADC target and developed an antibody, #84.7, with minimal reactivity to CEACAM6-expressing normal cells. EBET-conjugated #84.7 (84-EBET) has lethal effects on various PDAC organoids and bystander efficacy on CEACAM6-negative PDAC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. In mouse studies, a single injection of 84-EBET induces marked tumor regression in various PDAC-patient-derived xenografts, with a decrease in the inflammatory phenotype of stromal cells and without significant body weight loss. Combination with standard chemotherapy or PD-1 antibody induces more profound and sustained regression without toxicity enhancement. Our preclinical evidence demonstrates potential efficacy by delivering BET protein degrader to PDAC and its microenvironment via CEACAM6-targeted ADC."}

Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, and Mfn2 is currently believed to play a role in cancer inhibition in pancreatic cancer. In order to explore whether the anti-pancreatic cancer effect of LDM is related to Mfn2-mediated mitophagy, Bioinformatics and in vitro cell experiments are used for experimental research. The experimental results demonstrated that Mfn2 is correlated with mitochondrial autophagy in pancreatic cancer. Lidamycin can increase the expression of Mfn2 in pancreatic cancer and affect the process of EMT, affect the level of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase the expression of mitochondrial autophagy marker proteins BNIP3L and Beclin1. These results demonstrate that Mfn2 affects mitophagy in pancreatic cancer cells by regulating the expression of Mfn2."}

Early detection of ER+\u2009and TNBC is crucial in the choice of diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategy. Here we report the key genes associated to ER+\u2009and TNBC using RNA-Seq analysis and machine learning models. Three ER+\u2009and TNBC RNA seq datasets comprising 164 patients in-toto were selected for standard NGS hierarchical data processing and data analyses protocols. Enrichment pathway analysis and network analysis was done and finally top hub genes were identified. To come with a reliable classifier which could distinguish the distinct transcriptome patterns associated to ER+\u2009and TNBC, ML models were built employing Na\u00efve Bayes, SVM and kNN. 1730 common DEG\u2019s exhibiting significant logFC values with 0.05 p-value threshold were identified. A list of top ten hub genes were screened on the basis of maximal clique centrality (MCC) which included CDC20, CDK1, BUB1, AURKA, CDCA8, RRM2, TTK, CENPF, CEP55 and NDC80.These genes were found to be involved in crucial cell cycle pathways. k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) model was observed to be best classifier with accuracy 84%, specificity 66% and sensitivity 95% to differentiate between ER+\u2009and TNBC RNA-Seq transcriptomes. Our screened list of 10 hub genes can thus help unearth novel molecular signatures implicated in ER+\u2009and TNBC onset, prognosis and design of novel protocols for breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics."}

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis, we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multiomics analyses. We found that a deficiency of KMT2C, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive-stage SCLC, promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C-deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically, KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis-promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further, S-(5\u2032-adenosyl)-l-methionine, the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases, inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus, our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C- and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis, which suggested a potential epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability."}

Lund", "Keith Syson Chan", "Jlenia Guarnerio"], "abstract": "T cell-based immunotherapies have exhibited promising outcomes in tumor control; however, their efficacy is limited in immune-excluded tumors. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in shaping the tumor microenvironment and modulating immune infiltration. Despite the identification of distinct CAF subtypes using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), their functional impact on hindering T-cell infiltration remains unclear, particularly in soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) characterized by low response rates to T cell-based therapies. In this study, we characterize the STS microenvironment using murine models (in female mice) with distinct immune composition by scRNA-seq, and identify a subset of CAFs we termed glycolytic cancer-associated fibroblasts (glyCAF). GlyCAF rely on GLUT1-dependent expression of CXCL16 to impede cytotoxic T-cell infiltration into the tumor parenchyma. Targeting glycolysis decreases T-cell restrictive glyCAF accumulation at the tumor margin, thereby enhancing T-cell infiltration and augmenting the efficacy of chemotherapy. These findings highlight avenues for combinatorial therapeutic interventions in sarcomas and possibly other solid tumors. Further investigations and clinical trials are needed to validate these potential strategies and translate them into clinical practice."}

Because early-stage CC often has no symptoms, a non-invasive and convenient diagnostic method is needed to improve disease detection. In this study, we developed a new approach for differentiating both CC and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2/3, a precancerous lesion, from healthy individuals by exploring CC fatty acid metabolic reprogramming. Analysis of public datasets suggested that various fatty acid metabolizing enzymes were expressed at higher levels in CC tissues than in normal tissues. Correspondingly, 11 free fatty acids (FFAs) showed significantly different serum levels in CC patient samples compared with healthy donor samples. Nine of these 11 FFAs also displayed significant alterations in CIN2/3 patients. We then generated diagnostic models using combinations of these FFAs, with the optimal model including stearic and dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acids. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested that this diagnostic model could detect CC and CIN2/3 more accurately than using serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen level. In addition, the diagnostic model using FFAs was able to detect patients regardless of clinical stage or histological type. Overall, the serum FFA diagnostic model developed in this study could be a powerful new tool for the non-invasive early detection of CC and CIN2/3."}

MDS derived MSCs display higher mutational burdens, increased replicative stress, senescence, inflammatory gene expression, and distinct mutational signatures as compared to healthy MSCs. However, validation experiments in serial culture passages, chronological BM aspirations and backtracking of high confidence mutations by re-sequencing primary sorted MDS MSCs indicate that the discovered mutations are secondary to in\u00a0vitro expansion but not present in primary BM.

Defining how, when and where myeloma cell intrinsic and extrinsic bone microenvironmental mechanisms cause relapse is challenging with current biological approaches. Here, we report a biology-driven spatiotemporal hybrid agent-based model of the MM-bone microenvironment. Results indicate MM intrinsic mechanisms drive the evolution of treatment resistant disease but that the protective effects of bone microenvironment mediated drug resistance (EMDR) significantly enhances the probability and heterogeneity of resistant clones arising under treatment. Further, the model predicts that targeting of EMDR deepens therapy response by eliminating sensitive clones proximal to stroma and bone, a finding supported by in vivo studies. Altogether, our model allows for the study of MM clonal evolution over time in the bone microenvironment and will be beneficial for optimizing treatment efficacy so as to significantly delay disease relapse."}

Data from 140 luminal-type breast cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. Spearman analysis was used to assess the correlation between CT-L1 and CT-L3 body composition parameters pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors influencing hematologic toxicity. CT-L1 body composition parameters were positively correlated with CT-L3 body composition parameters in 34 patients. Severe hematological toxicity occurred in 46 cases among the patient cohort. A skeletal muscle index (SMI) of\u2009<\u200932.91 cm2/m2, initial tumor size\u2009\u2265\u20093.335\u00a0cm, and a glucose-to-neutrophil ratio (GLR)\u2009\u2265\u20092.88 were identified as independent risk factors for severe hematologic toxicity during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in luminal-type breast cancer patients. The sample size in this study is small, and the predictive capacity of GLR in hematologic toxicity requires further research for comprehensive validation. CT-L1 analysis represents a viable alternative to CT-L3 analysis for body composition assessment. Patients with a low skeletal muscle index were more prone to experiencing severe hematologic toxicity during neoadjuvant chemotherapy."}

We explored the correlation between Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT), Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT), and Muscle Mass (MM) as measured by CT scans, and overall survival (OS) following diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a retrospective review of medical records and CT scans of patients diagnosed with CRC between 2007 and 2018. Demographics, pathology, and clinical parameters were collected. Using Image-J software, we measured VAT, SAT, and MM. Survival rates were analyzed using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, and prognostic factors were assessed using multivariate Cox regression. Analysis included 408 patients with a mean age of 56.9\u00a0years and a median follow-up of 93.3\u00a0months. Colon and rectum/rectosigmoid colon cancers were equally distributed. The 5-year OS rate was 67.8%. There was no significant difference in OS rates based on SAT or VAT. However, higher MM was associated with a improved 5-year OS rate. Factors such as age, stage, grade, and surgery were also associated to OS rates. These findings suggest that higher muscle mass may lead to better outcomes for CRC patients, highlighting the potential impact of exercise and nutritional interventions on patient outcomes."}

To understand this better in patients, here we take advantage of our recent neoadjuvant treatment paradigm to map the infiltrating immune cell landscape of GBM and how this is altered following PD-1 checkpoint blockade using high dimensional proteomics, single cell transcriptomics, and quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade increases T cell infiltration and the proportion of a progenitor exhausted population of T cells found within the tumor. We identify an early activated and clonally expanded CD8+ T cell cluster whose TCR overlaps with a CD8+ PBMC population. Distinct changes are also observed in conventional type 1 dendritic cells that may facilitate T cell recruitment. Macrophages and monocytes still constitute the majority of infiltrating immune cells, even after anti-PD-1 therapy. Interferon-mediated changes in the myeloid population are consistently observed following PD-1 blockade; these also mediate an increase in chemotactic factors that recruit T cells. However, sustained high expression of T-cell-suppressive checkpoints in these myeloid cells continue to prevent the optimal activation of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Therefore, future immunotherapeutic strategies may need to incorporate the targeting of these cells for clinical benefit."}

To facilitate these types of studies, we developed a new dual-inducible system utilizing the tetracycline- and cumate-inducible systems driving HES3 and the PAX3::FOXO1 fusion-oncogene, respectively, as cooperating genes from fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma. With this model, we can independently induce expression of either HES3 or PAX3::FOXO1, as well as simultaneously induce expression of both genes. This new model will allow us to further investigate the cooperation between HES3 and PAX3::FOXO1 including the temporal requirements for genetic cooperation. Functionally, we show that dual-induction of PAX3::FOXO1 and HES3 modifies sphere formation in a HEK293T-based system. More broadly, this lentiviral dual-inducible system can be adapted for any cooperating genes (overexpression or knockdown), allowing for independent, simultaneous, or temporally controlled gene expression."}

However, the functional mechanisms, clinical significance, and potential applications of PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been fully elucidated. Functional enrichment of key PRGs was analyzed based on databases, and relationships between key PRGs and the immune microenvironment, immune cell infiltration, chemotherapy drug sensitivity, tumor progression genes, single-cell cellular subgroups, signal transduction pathways, transcription factor regulation, and miRNA regulatory networks were systematically explored. This study identified 5 key PRGs associated with CRC: BCL10, CDKN2A, DAPK1, PYGM and TIMP1. Then, RT-PCR was used to verify expression of these genes in CRC cells and tissues. Clinical significance and prognostic value of key genes were further verified by multiple datasets. Analyses of the immune microenvironment, immune cell infiltration, chemotherapy drug sensitivity, tumor progression genes, single-cell cellular subgroups, and signal transduction pathways suggest a close relationship between these key genes and development of CRC. In addition, a novel prognostic nomogram model for CRC was successfully constructed by combining important clinical indicators and the key genes. In conclusion, our findings offer new insights for understanding the pathogenesis of CRC, predicting CRC prognosis, and identifying multiple therapeutic targets for future CRC therapy."}

However, the precise contexts of selective translational control and the regulators of such mechanisms in cancer is poorly understood. Here, we uncovered CNOT3, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, as an essential modulator of translation in myeloid leukemia. Elevated CNOT3 expression correlates with unfavorable outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CNOT3 depletion induces differentiation and apoptosis and delayed leukemogenesis. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling uncovers c-MYC as a critical downstream target which is translationally regulated by CNOT3. Global analysis of mRNA features demonstrates that CNOT3 selectively influences expression of target genes in a codon usage dependent manner. Furthermore, CNOT3 associates with the protein network largely consisting of ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors in leukemia cells. Overall, our work elicits the direct requirement for translation efficiency in tumorigenesis and propose targeting the post-transcriptional circuitry via CNOT3 as a therapeutic vulnerability in AML."}

To better characterize the tumor progression trajectory, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of normal tissue, precancerous tissue, early-stage, advanced-stage cancer tissue, lymph node, and recurrent tumors tissue samples. We identify the transcriptional development trajectory of malignant epithelial cells and a tumorigenic epithelial subcluster regulated by TFDP1. Furthermore, we find that the infiltration of POSTN+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages gradually increases with tumor progression; their interaction or interaction with malignant cells also gradually increase to shape the desmoplastic microenvironment and reprogram malignant cells to promote tumor progression. Additionally, we demonstrate that during lymph node metastasis, exhausted CD8+ T cells with high CXCL13 expression strongly interact with tumor cells to acquire more aggressive phenotypes of extranodal expansion. Finally, we delineate the distinct features of malignant epithelial cells in primary and recurrent tumors, providing a theoretical foundation for the precise selection of targeted therapy for tumors at different stages. In summary, the current study offers a comprehensive landscape and deep insight into epithelial and microenvironmental reprogramming throughout initiation, progression, lymph node metastasis and recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."}

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with cancer progression, yet their formation mechanism and role in oncolytic virotherapy remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that, in glioma, upregulation of IGF2BP3 enhances the expression of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MIB1, promoting FTO degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This results in increased m6A-mediated CSF3 release and NET formation. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) stimulates IGF2BP3-induced NET formation in malignant glioma. In glioma models in female mice, a BET inhibitor enhances the oncolytic activity of oHSV by impeding IGF2BP3-induced NETosis, reinforcing virus replication through BRD4 recruitment with the CDK9/RPB-1 complex to HSV gene promoters. Our findings unveil the regulation of m6A-mediated NET formation, highlight oncolytic virus-induced NETosis as a critical checkpoint hindering oncolytic potential, and propose targeting NETosis as a strategy to overcome resistance in oncolytic virotherapy."}

Despite this transformational activity, patients eventually progress, mostly due to acquired resistance mutations or following discontinuation due to neuro-cognitive side effects. These patients have no therapeutic alternative and face a dismal prognosis. Notable, little is known about this drug\u2019s binding mode and its medicinal chemistry development, which is instrumental for the development of the next generation of drugs. Against this background, we solve the crystal structures of avapritinib in complex with wild-type and mutant PDGFRA and stem cell factor receptor (KIT), which provide evidence and understanding of inhibitor binding and lead to the identification of a sub-pocket (G\u03b1-pocket).

One of the main hurdles in solid tumors is the lack of sufficient T-cell infiltrate. Here, we show that pre-treatment vaccination, even when composed of tumor-unrelated antigens, induces CXCR3-mediated T-cell influx in immunologically \u2018cold\u2019 tumor models in male mice. In the absence of CD3 bsAb, the infiltrate is confined to the tumor invasive margin, whereas subsequent CD3 bsAb administration induces infiltration of activated effector CD8 T cells into the tumor cell nests. This combination therapy installs a broadly inflamed Th1-type tumor microenvironment, resulting in effective tumor eradication. Multiple vaccination formulations, including synthetic long peptides and viruses, empower CD3 bsAb therapy. Our results imply that eliciting tumor infiltration with vaccine-induced tumor-(un)related T cells can greatly improve the efficacy of CD3 bsAbs in solid tumors."}

Here we show that human NKTs expressing the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) undergo extensive and sustained molecular and functional reprogramming. Specifically, IL-12 instructs and maintains a Th1-polarization program in NKTs in vivo without causing their functional exhaustion. Furthermore, using CD62L as a marker of memory cells in human NKTs, we observe that IL-12 maintains long-term CD62L-expressing memory NKTs in vivo. Notably, IL-12 initiates a de novo programming of memory NKTs in CD62L-negative NKTs indicating that human NKTs circulating in the peripheral blood possess an intrinsic differentiation hierarchy, and that IL-12 plays a role in promoting their differentiation to long-lived Th1-polarized memory cells. Human NKTs engineered to co-express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) coupled with the expression of IL-12 show enhanced antitumor activity in leukemia and neuroblastoma tumor models, persist long-term in vivo and conserve the molecular signature driven by the IL-12 expression. Thus IL-12 reveals an intrinsic plasticity of peripheral human NKTs that may play a crucial role in the development of cell therapeutics."}

High Pin1 expression is associated with SUMO1-modified protein hypersumoylation in glioma stem cells (GSCs), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that Pin1 is deubiquitinated and stabilized by USP34, which promotes isomerization of the sole SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9, leading to SUMO1-modified hypersumoylation to support GSC maintenance. Pin1 interacts with USP34, a deubiquitinase with preferential expression and oncogenic function in GSCs. Such interaction is facilitated by Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Pin1. Disruption of USP34 or inhibition of Plk1 promotes poly-ubiquitination and degradation of Pin1. Furthermore, Pin1 isomerizes Ubc9 to upregulate Ubc9 thioester formation with SUMO1, which requires CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ubc9. Combined inhibition of Pin1 and CDK1 with sulfopin and RO3306 most effectively suppresses orthotopic tumor growth. Our findings provide multiple molecular targets to induce Pin1 degradation and suppress hypersumoylation for cancer treatment."}

In this study, we depicted the multi-omics landscapes of this rare lung cancer type by performing multi-regional sampling on 20 FLAC cases. A comparison of multi-omics profiles revealed significant differences between H-FLAC and L-FLAC in a multi-omic landscape. Two subtypes also showed distinct relationships between multi-layer intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). We discovered that a lower genetic ITH was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival and overall survival in FLAC patients, whereas higher methylation ITH in H-FLAC patients suggested a short survival. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity in FLAC and suggest that different types of ITH may have distinct implications for patient prognosis."}

With the development of a Realistic Anatomical Condition Experience (RACE) model, complex spatial-anatomical surgical areas and the associated intraoperative complexities could be transferred into a realistic training situation in head\u00a0and\u00a0neck surgery. The RACE model is based on a stereolithography file generated by intraoperative use of a three-dimensional surface scanner after neck dissection and before microvascular anastomosis. Modelling of the acquired STL file using three-dimensional processing software led to the model\u2019s final design. As a result, we have successfully created an economical, sustainable and realistic model for microsurgical education and provide a step-by-step workflow that can be used in surgical and general medical education to replicate and establish comparable models. We provide an open source stereolithography file of the head-and-neck RACE model for printing for educational purposes. Once implemented in other fields of surgery and general medicine, RACE models could mark a shift in medical education as a whole, away from traditional teaching principles and towards the use of realistic and individualised simulators."}

Possible associations between claudin 18.2 overexpression (moderate-to-strong expression in\u2009\u2265\u200975% by the 43-14A clone) and clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes were analyzed. There were 90 (30.1%), 96 (32.1%), and 113 (37.8%) patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was noted in 139 out of 299 patients (46.5%). Claudin 18.2 overexpression was associated with a younger age, a lower invasion depth limited to the mucosa/submucosa, and less frequent lymphovascular invasion. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was also associated with Borrmann type 4 among patients with advanced gastric cancer and the diffuse histological type. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was not an independent factor for survival outcomes. In conclusion, claudin 18.2 was overexpressed in almost half of resectable gastric cancer patients. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was associated with some clinicopathological characteristics, but was not an independent prognostic factor in a localized setting."}

For most patients with PDAC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with resectable disease, modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) is the standard-of-care adjuvant therapy, although data from several randomized trials have shown improved outcomes with neoadjuvant treatment strategies. For patients with advanced-stage or metastatic disease, comprehensive genomic profiling has revealed several potentially actionable alterations in small subsets of patients and the feasibility of implementing such strategies is beginning to be confirmed. Novel therapies targeting certain aberrations, most notably BRCA1/2 mutations, mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies or NTRK1\u20133 fusions, have shown considerable activity in clinical trials, and larotrectinib, entrectinib and pembrolizumab have received FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tumours harbouring NTRK fusions and MMR deficiencies, respectively, regardless of primary tumour histology. In this Review, we describe the available data on the activity of these and other agents in patients with PDAC.

Here, we show that Bone Marrow (BM) adipocytes dynamically evolve during ALL pathogenesis and therapy, transitioning from cellular depletion in the primary leukaemia niche to a fully reconstituted state upon remission induction. Functionally, adipocyte niches elicit a fate switch in ALL cells towards slow-proliferation and cellular quiescence, highlighting the critical contribution of the adipocyte dynamic to disease establishment and chemotherapy resistance. Mechanistically, adipocyte niche interaction targets posttranscriptional networks and suppresses protein biosynthesis in ALL cells. Treatment with general control nonderepressible 2 inhibitor (GCN2ib) alleviates adipocyte-mediated translational repression and rescues ALL cell quiescence thereby significantly reducing the cytoprotective effect of adipocytes against chemotherapy and other extrinsic stressors. These data establish how adipocyte driven restrictions of the ALL proteome benefit ALL tumours, preventing their elimination, and suggest ways to manipulate adipocyte-mediated ALL resistance."}

Effects evoked by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene deletion of A2AR are superior to shRNA mediated knockdown or pharmacological blockade of A2AR. Mechanistically, human A2AR-edited CAR T cells are significantly resistant to adenosine-mediated transcriptional changes, resulting in enhanced production of cytokines including IFN\u03b3 and TNF, and increased expression of JAK-STAT signaling pathway associated genes. A2AR deficient CAR T cells are well tolerated and do not induce overt pathologies in mice, supporting the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to target A2AR for the improvement of CAR T cell function in the clinic."}

A total of 324 CRC patients diagnosed through pathological examination from January 2017 to July 2022 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University were included. The prognosis of patients with metastatic CRC was examined, and the correlation between IL-10 expression in pathological tissues and IL-10 expression in serum was analyzed. The results showed that the prognosis of CRC was poorer when metastasis occurred (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Additionally, IL-10 was highly expressed in the metastatic CRC group (P\u2009=\u20090.018), and the expression of IL-10 in pathological tissues of patients with metastatic CRC was positively correlated with the expression of IL-10 in serum (P\u2009=\u20090.037). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-white blood cell ratio (LWR), aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were calculated and determined by ROC curve.

Inflammatory indexes with an AUC of more than 0.6 were selected, and each colorectal cancer patient with any of these risk factors was assigned a score of one. The 324 patients were then divided into two groups: 0\u20134 for the low-risk group and 4\u20138 for the high-risk group. The occurrence of distant metastases in the two groups was statistically analyzed. The results showed that the OS and PFS of the low-risk group were significantly superior to those of the high-risk group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). These findings indicate that NLR, LWR, AISI, MLR, SIRI, PNI, ALI, and IL-10 are risk factors for distant metastasis in CRC patients. Therefore, the prediction scores of these indexes can be used to effectively evaluate the prognosis of patients with metastatic CRC."}

This study evaluates the burden of common cancers in Almaty, Kazakhstan's major city, from 2017 to 2021, utilizing data from the Information System of the Ministry of Health. In Kazakhstan, most common cancers among men include lung, stomach, and prostate cancer, while breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers are predominant among women. Employing measures like disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), we found that selected cancer types accounted for a total DALY burden of 25,016.60 in 2021, with mortality contributing more than disability (95.2% vs. 4.7%) with the ratio of non-fatal to fatal outcomes being 1.4 times higher in women than in men. The share of non-fatal burden (YLD) proportion within DALYs increased for almost all selected cancer types, except stomach and cervical cancer over the observed period in Almaty. Despite the overall increase in cancer burden observed during the time period, a downward trend in specific cancers suggests the efficacy of implemented cancer control strategies. Comparison with global trends highlights the significance of targeted interventions. This analysis underscores the need for continuous comprehensive cancer control strategies in Almaty and Kazakhstan, including vaccination against human papillomavirus, stomach cancer screening programs, and increased cancer awareness initiatives."}

The deliverability of DCAT was evaluated according to the plan parameters, which affect the gantry rotation speed and resultant positional inaccuracies; the deliverability according to the number of control points and dose rates was investigated by using treatment machine log files and dosimetry devices, respectively. A non-negligible degradation in DCAT deliverability due to gantry wobble was observed in both the treatment machine log files and dosimetry devices. The resulting dose-delivery error occurred below a certain number of control points or above a certain dose rate. Dose simulations in the patient domain showed a similar impact on deteriorated deliverability. For targets located primarily in the isocenter, the dose differences were negligible, whereas for organs at risk located mainly off-isocenter, the dose differences were significant up to \u2212\u20098.77%. To ensure safe and accurate radiotherapy, optimal plan parameters should be selected, and gantry angle-specific validations should be conducted before treatment."}

The role of KIFC3 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the function of KIFC3 in NSCLC and the underlying mechanism. Immunohistochemistry indicated that KIFC3 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and correlated with the degree of differentiation, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. MTT, colony formation and Transwell assays demonstrated that KIFC3 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro, while KIFC3 knockdown led to the opposite results. The protein expression levels of PI3Kp85\u03b1 and p-Akt were increased after KIFC3 overexpression, meanwhile the downstream protein expression levels such as cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6, RhoA, RhoC and MMP2 were increased. This promotion effect could be inhibited by a specific inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, LY294002. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction between endogenous/exogenous KIFC3 and PI3Kp85\u03b1. Tumor formation experiments in nude mice confirmed that KIFC3 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vivo and performed its biological function through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.In conclusion, KIFC3 promotes the malignant behavior of NSCLC cells through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."}

Therefore, sensitive detection using panoramic radiography is clinically important. This study aimed to create a trained model to detect nasopalatine duct cysts from panoramic radiographs in a graphical user interface-based environment. This study was conducted on panoramic radiographs and CT images of 115 patients with nasopalatine duct cysts. As controls, 230 age- and sex-matched patients without cysts were selected from the same database. The 345 pre-processed panoramic radiographs were divided into 216 training data sets, 54 validation data sets, and 75 test data sets. Deep learning was performed for 400 epochs using pretrained-LeNet and pretrained-VGG16 as the convolutional neural networks to classify the cysts. The deep learning system's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using LeNet and VGG16 were calculated. LeNet and VGG16 showed an accuracy rate of 85.3% and 88.0%, respectively. A simple deep learning method using a graphical user interface-based Windows machine was able to create a trained model to detect nasopalatine duct cysts from panoramic radiographs, and may be used to prevent such cysts being overlooked during imaging."}

Recently uncovered, histone lysine lactylation (kla) has assumed a crucial role in cancer progression. However, the correlation with lncRNAs remains ambiguous. Scrutinizing lncRNAs associated with Kla not only improves clinical breast cancer management but also establishes a groundwork for antitumor drug development. We procured breast tissue samples, encompassing both normal and cancerous specimens, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Utilizing Cox regression and XGBoost methods, we developed a prognostic model using identified kla-related lncRNAs. The model's predictive efficacy underwent validation across training, testing, and the overall cohort. Functional analysis concerning kla-related lncRNAs ensued. We identified and screened 8 kla-related lncRNAs to formulate the risk model. Pathway analysis disclosed the connection between immune-related pathways and the risk model of kla-related lncRNAs. Significantly, the risk scores exhibited a correlation with both immune cell infiltration and immune function, indicating a clear association. Noteworthy is the observation that patients with elevated risk scores demonstrated an increased tumor mutation burden (TMB) and decreased tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) scores, suggesting heightened responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Our study uncovers a potential link between Kla-related lncRNAs and BC, providing innovative therapeutic guidelines for BC management."}

Herein, we present an ad hoc analysis of the NEOSTAR trial (NCT03158129) where we observed a phenomenon we refer to as \u201cnodal immune flare\u201d (NIF) in which patients treated with neoadjuvant ICIs demonstrate radiologically abnormal nodes post-therapy that upon pathological evaluation are devoid of cancer and demonstrate de novo non-caseating granulomas. Abnormal lymph nodes are analyzed by computed tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography to evaluate the size and the maximum standard uptake value post- and pre-therapy in NEOSTAR and an independent neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort. NIF occurs in 16% (7/44) of patients treated with ICIs but in 0% (0/28) of patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. NIF is associated with an inflamed nodal immune microenvironment and with fecal abundance of genera belonging to the family Coriobacteriaceae of phylum Actinobacteria, but not with tumor responses or treatment-related toxicity. Our findings suggest that this apparent radiological cancer progression in lymph nodes may occur due to an inflammatory response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, and such cases should be evaluated by pathological examination to distinguish NIF from true nodal progression and to\u00a0ensure appropriate clinical treatment planning."}

High-definition surgical videos and preoperative imaging data of 200 patients who underwent laparoscopic left-sided colorectal cancer surgery were analysed, and the alignment of the IMA and its branches in relation to the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) was observed and summarized. The above two methods were used to measure the length of the IMA and its branches. Of 200 patients, 47.0% had the sigmoid arteries (SAs) arise from the common trunk with the superior rectal artery (SRA), and 30.5% had the SAs arise from the common trunk with the left colic artery (LCA). In 3.5% of patients, the SAs arising from both the LCA and SRA. The LCA, SA, and SRA emanated from the same point in 13.5% of patients, and the LCA was absent in 5.5% of patients. The range of D cm (IMA length measured by intraoperative silk thread) and d cm (IMA length measured by 3D-CT vascular reconstruction) in all cases was 1.84\u20136.62\u00a0cm and 1.85\u20136.52\u00a0cm, respectively, and there was a significant difference between them.

To identify potentially actionable genetic variants, sequencing data of 351 Belgian ovarian cancer patients were retrospectively captured from electronic health records. The cohort included 286 (81%) patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, 17 (5%) with low-grade serous ovarian cancer, and 48 (14%) with other histotypes. Firstly, an overview of the prevalence and spectrum of the BRCA1/2 variants highlighted germline variants in 4% (11/250) and somatic variants in 11% (37/348) of patients. Secondly, application of a multi-gene panel in 168 tumors revealed a total of 214 variants in 28 genes beyond BRCA1/2 with a median of 1 (IQR, 1\u20132) genetic variant per patient. The ten most often altered genes were (in descending order): TP53, BRCA1, PIK3CA, BRCA2, KRAS, ERBB2 (HER2), TERT promotor, RB1, PIK3R1 and PTEN. Of note, the genetic landscape vastly differed between the studied histotypes. Finally, using ESCAT the clinical evidence of utility for every genetic variant was scored. Only BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants were classified as tier-I. Nearly all patients (151/168; 90%) had an ESCAT tier-II variant, most frequently in TP53 (74%), PIK3CA (9%) and KRAS (7%). In conclusion, our findings imply that although only a small proportion of genetic variants currently have direct impact on ovarian cancer treatment decisions, other variants could help to identify novel (personalized) treatment options to address the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer, particularly in rare histotypes."}

Our results show that platinum-chemotherapy itself enhances resistance by progressively changing the cancer cell-intrinsic adhesion signaling and cell-surrounding ECM. Examining ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) transcriptome and histology, we describe the fibrotic ECM heterogeneity at primary tumors and distinct metastatic sites, prior and after chemotherapy. Using cell models from systematic ECM screen to collagen-based 2D and 3D cultures, we demonstrate that both specific ECM substrates and stiffness increase resistance to platinum-mediated, apoptosis-inducing DNA damage via FAK and \u03b21 integrin-pMLC-YAP signaling. Among such substrates around metastatic HGSCs, COL6 was upregulated by chemotherapy and enhanced the resistance of relapse, but not treatment-na\u00efve, HGSC organoids. These results identify matrix adhesion as an adaptive response, driving HGSC aggressiveness via co-evolving ECM composition and sensing, suggesting stromal and tumor strategies for ECM pathway targeting."}

A total of 15 patients were enrolled, 14 of whom were assessed for treatment efficacy. There was a 21.4% overall response rate, with a disease control rate of 57.1%. The median overall survival and median progression-free survival were 17.9 (95% CI 13.5-not reach) months and 2.5 (95% CI 1.4-not reach) months, respectively. For patients with exonuclease domain mutations, the objective response rate was 66.7% (2/3), with a disease control rate of 66.7% (2/3). For those with non-exonuclease domain mutations, the rates were 9.1% (1/11) and 54.5% (6/11), respectively. Notably, patients with PBRM1 gene mutations exhibited a high response rate to toripalimab at 75.0% (3/4). This study showed that neither the exonuclease domain mutations nor non-exonuclease domain mutations could fully predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, urging the need for more investigations to clarify potential immune sensitization differences within polymerase epsilon/polymerase delta mutation variants."}

Recent discoveries have elucidated how these differing functions are mediated by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with specific T cell receptors and spatial distribution. Their relative resistance to mechanisms of dysfunction like T cell exhaustion has spurred the development of therapeutic approaches exploiting \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and an improved understanding of these cells should enable more effective immunotherapies."}

To understand how Notch signaling is overactivated to couple tumor metastasis and self-renewal in NSCLC cells, we performed the current study and showed that RFC4, a DNA replication factor amplified in more than 40% of NSCLC tissues, directly binds to the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1) to competitively abrogate CDK8/FBXW7-mediated degradation of NICD1. Moreover, RFC4 is a functional transcriptional target gene of Notch1 signaling, forming a positive feedback loop between high RFC4 and NICD1 levels and sustained overactivation of Notch signaling, which not only leads to NSCLC tumorigenicity and metastasis but also confers NSCLC cell resistance to treatment with the clinically tested drug DAPT against NICD1 synthesis. Furthermore, together with our study, analysis of two public datasets involving more than 1500 NSCLC patients showed that RFC4 gene amplification, and high RFC4 and NICD1 levels were tightly correlated with NSCLC metastasis, progression and poor patient prognosis. Therefore, our study characterizes the pivotal roles of the positive feedback loop between RFC4 and NICD1 in coupling NSCLC metastasis and stemness properties and suggests its therapeutic and diagnostic/prognostic potential for NSCLC therapy."}

Temporal activation of multiple cancer hallmark pathways and acquisition of 17q are observed in a refractory MCL. Multi-platform validation is performed at genomic and cellular levels in PDX models and larger patient cohorts. We demonstrate that due to 17q gain, BIRC5/survivin expression is upregulated in resistant MCL tumor cells and targeting BIRC5 results in marked tumor inhibition in preclinical models.

Common copy-number alterations include Chromosome (Ch.) 1p loss/1q gain, and Ch. 13q and Ch. 14q loss; focal alterations include PDGFRA and CDK4 gain and CDKN2A and BCOR loss. Transcriptomically, RIGs comprise a stem-like subgroup with lesser mutation burden and Ch. 1p loss and a pro-inflammatory subgroup with greater mutation burden and depleted DNA repair gene expression. Chromothripsis in several RIG samples is associated with extrachromosomal circular DNA-mediated amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4. Drug screening suggests microtubule inhibitors/stabilizers, DNA-damaging agents, MEK inhibition, and, in the inflammatory subgroup, proteasome inhibitors, as potentially effective therapies."}

However, intratumoral drug injections can result in substantial off-target leakage and are invisible under standard imaging modalities like ultrasound (US) and x-ray. A thermosensitive poloxamer-based gel for drug delivery was developed that is visible using x-ray imaging (computed tomography (CT), cone beam CT, fluoroscopy), as well as using US by means of integrating perfluorobutane-filled microbubbles (MBs). MBs content was optimized using tissue mimicking phantoms and ex vivo bovine livers. Gel formulations less than 1% MBs provided gel depositions that were clearly identifiable on US and distinguishable from tissue background and with minimal acoustic artifacts. The cross-sectional areas of gel depositions obtained with US and CT imaging were similar in studies using ex vivo bovine liver and postmortem in situ swine liver. The gel formulation enhanced multimodal image-guided navigation, enabling fusion of ultrasound and x-ray/CT imaging, which may enhance targeting, definition of spatial delivery, and overlap of tumor and gel. Although speculative, such a paradigm for intratumoral drug delivery might streamline clinical workflows, reduce radiation exposure by reliance on US, and boost the precision and accuracy of drug delivery targeting during procedures. Imageable gels may also provide enhanced temporal and spatial control of intratumoral conformal drug delivery."}

Patients in the highest quartile were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a younger age (66.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3 vs. 69.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Subgroup analysis of patients with localized or stage 4 prostate cancer showed no significant differences in biochemical failure or overall survival. This hospital-based cohort study observed that a higher PRS was associated with increased susceptibility to prostate cancer and younger age of diagnosis. However, PRS was not found to be a significant predictor of disease stage and prognosis. These findings suggest that PRS could serve as a useful tool in prostate cancer risk assessment."}

Newman", "Yury Patskovsky", "Larysa Patskovska", "Andrew S. Ishizuka", "Geoffrey M. Lynn", "Robert A. Seder", "Michelle Krogsgaard", "Nina Bhardwaj"], "abstract": "T cell receptors (TCR) are pivotal in mediating tumour cell cytolysis via recognition of mutation-derived tumour neoantigens (neoAgs) presented by major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I). Understanding the factors governing the emergence of neoAg from somatic mutations is a major focus of current research. However, the structural and cellular determinants controlling TCR recognition of neoAgs remain poorly understood. This study describes the multi-level analysis of a model neoAg from the B16F10 murine melanoma, H2-Db/Hsf2 p.K72N68-76, as well as its cognate TCR 47BE7. Through cellular, molecular and structural studies we demonstrate that the p.K72N mutation enhances H2-Db binding, thereby improving cell surface presentation and stabilizing the TCR 47BE7 epitope. Furthermore, TCR 47BE7 exhibited high functional avidity and selectivity, attributable to a broad, stringent, binding interface enabling recognition of native B16F10 despite low antigen density. Our findings provide insight into the generation of anchor-residue modified neoAg, and emphasize the value of molecular and structural investigations of neoAg in diverse MHC-I contexts for advancing the understanding of neoAg immunogenicity."}

Jeffrey Zabel", "Nader Allam", "Warren D. Foltz", "Costel Flueraru", "Edward Taylor", "I. Alex Vitkin"], "abstract": "Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is emerging as a valuable tool for non-invasive volumetric monitoring of the tumor vascular status and its therapeutic response. However, clinical utility of DCE-MRI is challenged by uncertainty in its ability to quantify the tumor microvasculature (\\(\\mu \\mathrm{m}\\) scale) given its relatively poor spatial resolution (mm scale at best). To address this challenge, we directly compared DCE-MRI parameter maps with co-registered micron-scale-resolution speckle variance optical coherence tomography (svOCT) microvascular images in a window chamber tumor mouse model. Both semi and fully quantitative (Toft\u2019s model) DCE-MRI metrics were tested for correlation with microvascular svOCT biomarkers. svOCT\u2019s derived vascular volume fraction (VVF) and the mean distance to nearest vessel (\\(\\overline{\\mathrm{DNV} }\\)) metrics were correlated with DCE-MRI vascular biomarkers such as time to peak contrast enhancement (\\(r=-0.81\\) and \\(0.83\\) respectively, \\(P<0.0001\\) for both), the area under the gadolinium-time concentration curve (\\(r=0.50\\) and \\(-0.48\\) respectively, \\(P<0.0001\\) for both) and \\({k}_{trans}\\) (\\(r=0.64\\) and \\(-0.61\\) respectively, \\(P<0.0001\\) for both). Several other correlated micro\u2013macro vascular metric pairs were also noted.

Reduced NAD\u2009+\u2009levels are postulated to be associated with cancer. As interest in understanding NAD\u2009+\u2009dynamics in cancer patients with therapeutic applications in mind grows, there remains a shortage of comprehensive data. This study delves into NAD\u2009+\u2009dynamics in patients undergoing surgery for different digestive system cancers. This prospective study enrolled 99 patients with eight different cancers. Fasting blood samples were obtained during the perioperative period. The concentrations of NAD\u2009+\u2009, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and nicotinamide riboside were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry.  After erythrocyte volume adjustment, NAD\u2009+\u2009remained relatively stable after surgery. Meanwhile, NMN decreased the day after surgery and displayed a recovery trend. Interestingly, liver and pancreatic cancer patients exhibited poor postoperative NMN recovery, suggesting a potential cancer type-specific influence on NAD\u2009+\u2009metabolism. This study illuminated the behavior of NAD\u2009+\u2009in surgically treated cancer patients. We identified which cancer types have particularly low levels and at what point depletion occurs during the perioperative period. These insights suggest the need for personalized NAD\u2009+\u2009supplementation strategies, calibrated to individual patient needs and treatment timelines.

Mathematical-computational tools could be valuable for integrating experimental results and understanding the phenotypic plasticity mechanisms for CSCs emergence. Based on the literature review, we constructed a Boolean model that recovers eight stable states (attractors) corresponding to the gene expression profile of hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells in senescent, quiescent, proliferative, and stem-like states. The epigenetic landscape associated with the regulatory network was analyzed. We observed that the loss of p53, p16, RB, or the constitutive activation of \u03b2-catenin and YAP1 increases the robustness of the proliferative stem-like phenotypes. Additionally, we found that p53 inactivation facilitates the transition of proliferative hepatocytes into stem-like mesenchymal phenotype. Thus, phenotypic plasticity may be altered, and stem-like phenotypes related to CSCs may be easier to attain following the mutation acquisition."}

Despite the recent advancements in cancer treatment, there is currently no approved therapy for metastasis. The present study reveals a potent and selective activity of PRAK in the regulation of tumor metastasis. While showing no apparent effect on the growth of primary breast cancers or subcutaneously inoculated tumor lines, Prak deficiency abrogates lung metastases in PyMT mice or mice receiving intravenous injection of tumor cells. Consistently, PRAK expression is closely associated with metastatic risk in human cancers. Further analysis indicates that loss of function of PRAK leads to a pronounced inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 protein synthesis, possibly due to reduced mTORC1 activities. Notably, pharmacological inactivation of PRAK with a clinically relevant inhibitor recapitulates the anti-metastatic effect of Prak depletion, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting PRAK in the control of metastasis."}

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main form of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The diagnosis and prognosis of HCC using current methods still face numerous challenges. This study aims to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic models while identifying new biomarkers for improved HCC treatment. Diagnostic and prognostic models for HCC were constructed using traditional binary classification methods and machine learning algorithms based on the TCGA database (Downloaded in August 2023). The mechanisms by which APLN (Apelin) affects HCC were investigated using single-cell sequencing data sourced from the GEO database (GSE149614). The diagnostic models yielded by various algorithms could effectively distinguished HCC samples from normal ones. The prognostic model, composed of four genes, was constructed using LASSO and Cox regression algorithms, demonstrating good performance in predicting the three-year survival rate of HCC patients. The HCC biomarker Apelin (APLN) was identified in this study. APLN in liver cancer tissues mainly comes from endothelial cells and is associated with the carcinogenesis of these cells. APLN expression is significantly upregulated in liver cancer tissues, marking it as a viable indicator of endothelial cell malignancy in HCC. Furthermore, APLN expression was determined to be an independent predictor of tumor endothelial cell carcinogenesis, unaffected by its modifications such as single nucleotide variation, copy number variation, and methylation. Additionally, liver cancers characterized by high APLN expression are likely to progress rapidly after T2 stage. Our study presents diagnostic and prognostic models for HCC with appreciably improved accuracy and reliability compared to previous reports. APLN is a reliable HCC biomarker and contributes to the establishment of our models."}

Preclinical and preliminary clinical results confirmed the synergistic antitumor effects of apatinib in combination with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. In this study, we investigated camptothecin (CPT) enhances the anti-tumor effect of low-dose apatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor on hepatocellular carcinoma. CPT combined with a PD-1 inhibitor enhances the anti-tumor effects of low-dose apatinib in hepatocellular carcinoma which was evaluated in making use of the H22 mouse model (n\u2009=\u200932), which was divided into four groups. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting were used to detect nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as well as sequestosome 1 (p62), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), PD-1, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). The results showed that the average size of the tumor of the combination group (Group D) was significantly less than that of the apatinib\u2009+\u2009PD-1 inhibitor group (Group C). The expression levels of Nrf2, p62, VEGFA, VEGFR2, PD-1, and PD-L1 in the apatinib\u2009+\u2009PD-1 inhibitor group(Group C) were lower than those in the control group (Group A) (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Randomised controlled trial (RCT) on music therapy for anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients was searched from 7 major databases, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, WOS, CNIC, Wanfang, and Wipro, spanning the period of library construction to 23 October 2023, and the literature screening of music therapy for anxiety or depression in breast cancer patients was carried out by 2 experimentalists, each of whom conducted a literature screening RCT independently of the other anxiety or depression in a RCT. Methodological quality was evaluated using the PEDro scale; GRADE profiler software for quality of evidence; and RevMan 5.4 was used for effect size merging and forest plots; publication bias tests and sensitivity analyses were performed using Stata 17.0; and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were used as the effect statistics. A total of 13 RCTs with 1326 subjects (aged 18\u201370\u00a0years) were included in the literature, with a mean PEDro score of 6.8, and the literature was overall of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis showed that music therapy improved anxiety in breast cancer patients (841 cases), with a combined effect size (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.82, 95% CI [\u2212\u20091.03, \u2212\u20090.61] and P\u2009<\u20090.001); and improved depression in breast cancer patients (387 cases) with a combined effect size (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.76, 95% CI [\u2212\u20091.15, \u2212\u20090.38], P\u2009<\u20090.001). Subgroup analyses showed that music intervention with off-site music (757 cases) and music choice of non-self-selected music (537 cases) had the best effect on anxiety improvement, with corresponding combined effect sizes (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.88, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.83, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively; followed by an intervention length of\u2009<\u200930\u00a0min (589 cases), a frequency of 2 times/day (382 cases), and intervention period of 2\u20133\u00a0weeks (101 cases) had the best effect on anxiety improvement, and the corresponding combined effect sizes were (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.80, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.91, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.02, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively; and the music selection was the choice of one's own favourite music among the expert recommendations (219 cases) (270 cases) had the best effect on the improvement of depressed mood, with combined effect sizes of (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.15, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.71, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and music with an intervention duration of 30\u00a0min (287 cases), an intervention frequency of 1 time/day (348 cases), and an intervention period of 2\u20134\u00a0weeks (120 cases), respectively, with corresponding combined effect sizes of (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.75, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.86, P\u2009<\u20090.001; SMD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.06, P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Music therapy can improve anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients, and the level of evidence is moderate. Although the heterogeneity between studies is high, which may lead to bias in the results, we explored the source of heterogeneity through subgroup and sensitivity analyses, providing a good evidence-based basis for clinical practice. The heterogeneity of anxiety and depression was explored by subgroup analysis, with anxiety due to music duration and music cycle; and depression due to intervention cycles and music duration. Sensitivity analyses also identified music duration and music cycle as contributing to the heterogeneity. Also, this study has some limitations since the included literature did not take into account the duration of the disease, education, and family economic status and did not categorize the age stages. This study found that music therapy improves anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients and the results can be used as a basis for clinical practice and researcher enquiry.

We utilize a panel of 16 serum factors to show that a circulating level of serum amyloid A (SAA)\u2009>\u200920.0\u2009mg/L has the highest accuracy in predicting anti-PD-1 resistance in HCC. Further experiments show a correlation between peritumoral SAA expression and circulating SAA levels in patients with progressive disease after PD-1 inhibition. In vitro experiments demonstrate that SAA induces neutrophils to express PD-L1 through glycolytic activation via an LDHA/STAT3 pathway and to release oncostatin M, thereby attenuating cytotoxic T cell function. In vivo, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 or SAA eliminates neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression and enhances antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment. This study indicates that SAA may be a critical inflammatory cytokine implicated in anti-PD-1 resistance in HCC. Targeting SAA-induced PD-L1+ neutrophils through STAT3 or SAA inhibition may present a potential approach for overcoming anti-PD1 resistance."}

DDOST is associated with several cancers and congenital disorders of glycosylation. However, its role in pancreatic cancer remains elusive, despite its enriched pancreatic expression. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we identify 30 differentially expressed proteins and phosphopeptides (DEPs) after DDOST knockdown in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line PA-TU-8988T. We evaluated DDOST / DEP protein\u2013protein interaction networks using STRING database, correlation of mRNA levels in pancreatic cancer TCGA data, and biological processes annotated to DEPs in Gene Ontology database. The inferred DDOST regulated phenotypes were experimentally verified in two PDAC cell lines, PA-TU-8988T and BXPC-3. We found decreased proliferation and cell viability after DDOST knockdown, whereas ER-stress, ROS-formation and apoptosis were increased. In conclusion, our results support an oncogenic role of DDOST in PDAC by intercepting cell stress events and thereby reducing apoptosis. As such, DDOST might be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC."}

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often occurs in patients with chronic liver disease, which increases the risk of PHLF. This study aimed to investigate the ability of the combination of liver function and fibrosis markers (ALBI score and FIB-4 index) to predict PHLF in patients with HCC. Patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between August 2012 and September 2022 were considered for inclusion. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with PHLF, and ALBI score and FIB-4 index were combined based on their regression coefficients. The performance of the combined ALBI-FIB4 score in predicting PHLF and postoperative mortality was compared with Child\u2013Pugh score, MELD score, ALBI score, and FIB-4 index. A total of 215 patients were enrolled in this study. PHLF occurred in 35 patients (16.3%). The incidence of severe PHLF (grade B and grade C PHLF) was 9.3%. Postoperative 90\u2010d mortality was 2.8%. ALBI score, FIB-4 index, prothrombin time, and extent of liver resection were identified as independent factors for predicting PHLF. The AUC of the ALBI-FIB4 score in predicting PHLF was 0.783(95%CI: 0.694\u20130.872), higher than other models. The ALBI-FIB4 score could divide patients into two risk groups based on a cut-off value of \u2212\u00a01.82. High-risk patients had a high incidence of PHLF of 39.1%, while PHLF just occurred in 6.6% of low-risk patients. Similarly, the AUCs of the ALBI-FIB4 score in predicting severe PHLF and postoperative 90-d mortality were also higher than other models. Preoperative ALBI-FIB4 score showed good performance in predicting PHLF and postoperative mortality in patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC, superior to the currently commonly used liver function and fibrosis scoring systems."}

BUB1 was also found to promote the proliferative, migratory, invasive activity of SCLC cells, as shown by CCK-8, 3D migration wound-healing, and Transwell assays, as well as flow cytometry. Additionally, it was found that BUB1 silencing enhanced E-cadherin expression while suppressing N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB-1, and Snail levels, as shown by Western immunoblotting. The loss of BUB1 also reduced p-AKT and p-mTOR levels without altering total AKT or mTOR protein levels. In conclusion, BUB1 functions as an oncogenic promoter in SCLC, potentially regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by activation of AKT/mTOR signaling."}

Here, we introduce a mutated calcineurin subunit A (CNA) and a CD19-specific CAR into the T cell receptor \u03b1 constant (TRAC) locus to generate cells that are resistant to the widely used immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA). These immunosuppressant-resistant universal (IRU) CAR-T cells display improved effector function in vitro and anti-tumour efficacy in a leukemia xenograft mouse model in the presence of CsA, compared with CAR-T cells carrying wild-type CNA. Moreover, IRU CAR-T cells retain effector function in vitro and in vivo in the presence of both allogeneic T cells and CsA.

Here, we perform a comprehensive deep learning-based phenotyping of multiple cohorts of patients. We show that deep learning can reproduce the diagnosis of HCC vs. CCA with a high performance. We analyze a series of 405 cHCC-CCA patients and demonstrate that the model can reclassify the tumors as HCC or ICCA, and that the predictions are consistent with clinical outcomes, genetic alterations and in situ spatial gene expression profiling. This type of approach could improve treatment decisions and ultimately clinical outcome for patients with rare and biphenotypic cancers such as cHCC-CCA."}

In this study, we introduce Ceograph, a cell spatial organization-based graph convolutional network designed to analyze cell spatial organization (for example,. the cell spatial distribution, morphology, proximity, and interactions) derived from pathology images. Ceograph identifies key cell spatial organization features by accurately predicting their influence on patient clinical outcomes. In patients with oral potentially malignant disorders, our model highlights reduced structural concordance and increased closeness in epithelial substrata as driving features for an elevated risk of malignant transformation. In lung cancer patients, Ceograph detects elongated tumor nuclei and diminished stroma-stroma closeness as biomarkers for insensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With its potential to predict various clinical outcomes, Ceograph offers a deeper understanding of biological processes and supports the development of personalized therapeutic strategies."}

In this study, a comprehensive multi-omics methodology was employed to examine a distinctive collection of patient dataset containing rapid autopsy tumor and normal tissue samples as well as longitudinal imaging with a focus on pancreatic cancer. By performing a whole exome sequencing analysis on tumor and normal tissues to identify somatic gene variants and a radiomic feature analysis to tumor CT images, the genome-wide association approach established a connection between pancreatic cancer driver genes and relevant radiomic features, enabling a thorough and quantitative assessment of the heterogeneity of pancreatic tumors. The significant association between sets of genes and radiomic features revealed the involvement of genes in shaping tumor morphological heterogeneity. Some results of the association established a connection between the molecular level mechanism and their outcomes at the level of tumor structural heterogeneity. Because tumor structure and tumor structural heterogeneity are related to the patients\u2019 overall survival, patients who had pancreatic cancer driver gene mutations with an association to a certain radiomic feature have been observed to experience worse survival rates than cases without these somatic mutations. Furthermore, the association analysis has revealed potential gene mutations and radiomic feature candidates that warrant further investigation in future research endeavors."}

Platinum-based chemotherapy has a major role as first-line therapy for most patients with aUC. The approval of the anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab as maintenance therapy for patients without initial disease progression on platinum-based chemotherapy is an important development that has improved the survival outcomes of patients with this disease. Otherwise, the use of first-line immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 has been restricted to patients who are ineligible for platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Other important developments include the FDA-accelerated approval of first-line enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab for patients ineligible to receive cisplatin and the availability of FGFR inhibitors, enfortumab vedotin and sacituzumab govitecan for subsequent lines of therapy. Several research questions remain unaddressed including the lack of adequate biomarkers, how to assign priority to the different treatment options for individual patients and which agents can be effective as monotherapies. The future is promising with the emergence of modalities such as antibody\u2013drug conjugate-like drugs, next-generation ICIs, bispecific antibodies and cellular therapies. In this Review, we summarize the evolution of systemic therapy for patients with aUC and provide insights into the unmet needs."}

This study aimed to investigate the specific types of AEs linked to renal impairment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receiving FTD/TPI, using real-world data. Among the patients included in the REGOTAS study (a retrospective study of FTD/TPI versus regorafenib), those treated with FTD/TPI were evaluated. Creatinine clearance values of <\u200930, 30\u201360, 60\u201390, and\u2009>\u200990\u00a0mL/min were defined as severe, moderate, mild renal impairment, and normal renal function, respectively. Renal impairment was analyzed as a risk factor for grade 3 or higher AEs using a logistic regression model. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) based on renal impairment were evaluated. A total of 309 patients were included in the analysis, with 124, 130, and 55 patients divided into the normal, mild, and moderate-to-severe groups, respectively. The risk of grade 3 or higher neutropenia was significantly higher in the moderate-to-severe group (odds ratio 3.47; 95% confidence interval 1.45\u20138.30; P\u2009=\u20090.005), but there was no significant increase in the risk of non-hematologic AEs in any of the groups. The OS and PFS of patients in the mild and moderate-to-severe groups were comparable to those in the normal group. Patients with mCRC and moderate/severe renal impairment receiving FTD/TPI therapy may develop severe neutropenia; however, FTD/TPI remains a viable treatment option due to its clinical benefit."}

The application of a relatively recent and highly sensitive imaging technique, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography\u2014computed tomography (PET/CT), has enhanced the identification of metastatic disease. Nevertheless, as PSMA is expressed in various tissue types, the clinical importance of a PSMA-avid thyroid lesion remains largely uncertain. A minor, yet noteworthy, percentage of these lesions are ultimately determined to be malignant. Here we describe the case of a 70-year-old man with a past medical history of Lynch syndrome who presented to an outpatient oncologic clinic for management of very high risk localized PCa. He developed metastatic recurrence and his disease progressed through several lines of therapy, including immunotherapy and targeted treatments. He was found to have a new, intense PSMA uptake in an existing, previously benign thyroid nodule. Sonographic evaluation revealed changing morphology despite grossly stable size. Repeat biopsy confirmed the unusual finding of PCa metastasis to a known thyroid nodule. The shift in PSMA avidity played a pivotal role in discerning this metastatic deposit. There is a potential risk that such lesions may be inadequately acknowledged. The impact of the patient\u2019s Lynch syndrome on this presentation remains uncertain."}

Here, we describe a patient with two treatment-emergent metastatic lesions, one to the brain with neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) histology and one to the dural membrane of adenocarcinoma histology. We performed genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic characterization of these lesions and the primary tumor to investigate molecular features promoting these metastases. The two metastatic lesions had high genomic similarity, including TP53 mutation and PTEN deletion, with the most striking difference being the additional loss of RB1 in the NEPC lesion. Interestingly, the dural lesion expressed both androgen receptor and neuroendocrine markers, suggesting amphicrine carcinoma (AMPC). When analyzing pioneer transcription factors, the AMPC lesion exhibited elevated FOXA1 activity while the brain NEPC lesion showed elevated HOXC10, NFYB, and OTX2 expression suggesting novel roles in NEPC formation or brain tropism. Our results highlight the utility of performing multi-omic characterization, especially in rare cancer subtypes."}

The field of radiotheranostics, which is the focus of this Review, combines molecular imaging (primarily PET and SPECT) with targeted radionuclide therapy, which involves the use of small molecules, peptides and/or antibodies as carriers for therapeutic radionuclides, typically those emitting \u03b1-, \u03b2- or auger-radiation. The exponential, global expansion of radiotheranostics in oncology stems from its potential to target and eliminate tumour cells with minimal adverse effects, owing to a mechanism of action that differs distinctly from that of most other systemic therapies. Currently, an enormous opportunity exists to expand the number of patients who can benefit from this technology, to address the urgent needs of many thousands of patients across the world. In this Review, we describe the clinical experience with established radiotheranostics as well as novel areas of research and various barriers to progress."}

Nakayama", "Yusuke Ohba", "Bon-Kyoung Koo", "Shigetsugu Hatakeyama"], "abstract": "Frequent mutation of the tumour suppressor RNF43 is observed in many cancers, particularly colon malignancies. RNF43, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates Wnt signalling by inducing degradation of the Wnt receptor Frizzled. In this study, we discover that RNF43 activity requires phosphorylation at a triplet of conserved serines. This phospho-regulation of RNF43 is required for zebrafish development and growth of mouse intestinal organoids. Cancer-associated mutations that abrogate RNF43 phosphorylation cooperate with active Ras to promote tumorigenesis by abolishing the inhibitory function of RNF43 in Wnt signalling while maintaining its inhibitory function in p53 signalling. Our data suggest that RNF43 mutations cooperate with KRAS mutations to promote multi-step tumorigenesis via the Wnt-Ras-p53 axis in human colon cancers. Lastly, phosphomimetic substitutions of the serine trio restored the tumour suppressive activity of extracellular oncogenic mutants. Therefore, harnessing phospho-regulation of RNF43 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for tumours with RNF43 mutations."}

How alternate splicing regulates tumor development and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer remain poorly understood. Here we show that RNF113A, whose loss-of-function causes the X-linked trichothiodystrophy, is overexpressed in lung cancer and protects from Cisplatin-dependent cell death. RNF113A is a RNA-binding protein which regulates the splicing of multiple candidates involved in cell survival. RNF113A deficiency triggers cell death upon DNA damage through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis via the destabilization of the prosurvival protein MCL-1, ferroptosis due to enhanced SAT1 expression, and increased production of ROS due to altered Noxa1 expression. RNF113A deficiency circumvents the resistance to Cisplatin and to BCL-2 inhibitors through the destabilization of MCL-1, which thus defines spliceosome inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat tumors showing acquired resistance to specific drugs due to MCL-1 stabilization."}

However, hallmarks of cancer such as aberrant protein phosphorylation and calcium-mediated cell signalling provide broadly conserved molecular targets. Here, we show that, for a range of solid tumours, a cyclic octapeptide labelled with a near-infrared dye selectively binds to phosphorylated Annexin A2 (pANXA2), with high affinity at high levels of calcium. Because of cancer-cell-induced pANXA2 expression in tumour-associated stromal cells, the octapeptide preferentially binds to the invasive edges of tumours and then traffics within macrophages to the tumour\u2019s necrotic core. As proof-of-concept applications, we used the octapeptide to detect tumour xenografts and metastatic lesions, and to perform fluorescence-guided surgical tumour resection, in mice. Our findings suggest that high levels of pANXA2 in association with elevated calcium are present in the microenvironment of most solid cancers. The octapeptide might be broadly useful for selective tumour imaging and for delivering drugs to the edges and to the core of solid tumours."}

F. prausnitzii anticorrelated with BA, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines. Combined, these MG and MB biomarkers markedly determined prognosis.

The normal bronchial organoids maintain cellular components of normal bronchial mucosa. Lung cancer organoids respond to drugs based on their genomic alterations: a BRCA2-mutant organoid to olaparib, an EGFR-mutant organoid to erlotinib, and an EGFR-mutant/MET-amplified organoid to crizotinib.

As a result, mitochondria have become a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, leading to the development of compounds known as mitocans. In our group, we have consolidated the search of anticancer therapies based on natural products derived from plants, obtaining extracts such as P2Et from Caesalpinia spinosa and Anamu-SC from Petiveria alliacea, which have been shown to have antitumor activities in different cancer models. These extracts, due to their complex molecular composition, can interfere with multiple functions during tumor progression. To better understand how these natural products operate (P2Et and Anamu-SC), we constructed a model using 4T1 murine breast cancer cells with reduced expression of genes associated with glycolysis (Hexokinase-2) and mitochondrial function (Cqbp). The results indicate that the cells were more sensitive to the Anamu-SC extract, showing significant decreases in glucose consumption, ATP production, and oxygen consumption rate. Additionally, we observed changes in mitochondrial function, which reduced the cells\u2019 ability to migrate, particularly when C1qbp was silenced.

Here we demonstrate specificity redirection by rational design using structure-guided computational biology to generate a TRBC2-specific antibody (KFN), complementing the antibody previously described by our laboratory with unique TRBC1 specificity (Jovi-1) in targeting broader spectrum of T cell malignancies clonally expressing either of the two chains. This permits generation of paired reagents (chimeric antigen receptor-T cells) specific for TRBC1 and TRBC2, with preclinical evidence to support their efficacy in T cell malignancies."}

Here we address this question in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), in which we previously identified 4 CAF populations. While the global content in stroma increases in HGSOC after chemotherapy, the proportion of FAP+ CAF (also called CAF-S1) decreases. Still, maintenance of high residual CAF-S1 content after chemotherapy is associated with reduced CD8+ T lymphocyte density and poor patient prognosis, emphasizing the importance of CAF-S1 reduction upon treatment. Single cell analysis, spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry reveal that the content in the ECM-producing ANTXR1+ CAF-S1 cluster (ECM-myCAF) is the most affected by chemotherapy. Moreover, functional assays demonstrate that ECM-myCAF isolated from HGSOC reduce CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity through a Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1)-dependent mechanism. Thus, efficient inhibition after treatment of YAP1-signaling pathway in the ECM-myCAF cluster could enhance CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity. Altogether, these data pave the way for therapy targeting YAP1 in ECM-myCAF in HGSOC."}

Nonetheless, understanding of GBM heterogeneity is largely limited to the surgically resectable tumor core lesion while the seeds for recurrence reside in the unresectable tumor edge. In this study, stratification of GBM to core and edge demonstrates clinically relevant surgical sequelae. We establish regionally derived models of GBM edge and core that retain their spatial identity in a cell autonomous manner. Upon xenotransplantation, edge-derived cells show a higher capacity for infiltrative growth, while core cells demonstrate core lesions with greater therapy resistance. Investigation of intercellular signaling between these two tumor populations uncovers the paracrine crosstalk from tumor core that promotes malignancy and therapy resistance of edge cells. These phenotypic alterations are initiated by HDAC1 in GBM core cells which subsequently affect edge cells by secreting the soluble form of CD109 protein. Our data reveal the role of intracellular communication between regionally different populations of GBM cells in tumor recurrence."}

We hypothesized that investigating intratumor heterogeneity in meningiomas would elucidate biologic drivers and reveal new targets for molecular therapy. To test this hypothesis, here we perform multiplatform molecular profiling of 86 spatially-distinct samples from 13 human meningiomas. Our data reveal that regional alterations in chromosome structure underlie clonal transcriptomic, epigenomic, and histopathologic signatures in meningioma. Stereotactic co-registration of sample coordinates to preoperative magnetic resonance images further suggest that high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) distinguishes meningioma regions with proliferating cells enriched for developmental gene expression programs. To understand the function of these genes in meningioma, we develop a human cerebral organoid model of meningioma and validate the high ADC marker genes CDH2 and PTPRZ1 as potential targets for meningioma therapy using live imaging, single cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR interference, and pharmacology."}

Tobias", "Timour Baslan", "Katerina Politi", "Robert H. Vonderheide", "Ben Z. Stanger"], "abstract": "Acquired resistance to immunotherapy remains a critical yet incompletely understood biological mechanism. Here, using a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to study tumor relapse following immunotherapy-induced responses, we find that resistance is reproducibly associated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with EMT-transcription factors ZEB1 and SNAIL functioning as master genetic and epigenetic regulators of this effect. Acquired resistance in this model is not due to immunosuppression in the tumor immune microenvironment, disruptions in the antigen presentation machinery, or altered expression of immune checkpoints. Rather, resistance is due to a tumor cell-intrinsic defect in T-cell killing. Molecularly, EMT leads to the epigenetic and transcriptional silencing of interferon regulatory factor 6 (Irf6), rendering tumor cells less sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of TNF-\u03b1. These findings indicate that acquired resistance to immunotherapy may be mediated by programs distinct from those governing primary resistance, including plasticity programs that render tumor cells impervious to T-cell killing."}

We aimed to comprehensively investigate its biological characteristics and clinical value in glioma. We analyzed 699 glioma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas as training cohort and 325 samples from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas as validation cohort. All the statistical analyses and figures were generated with R. ANXA2 was overexpressed significantly in high-grade glioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type and mesenchymal-subtype glioma. ANXA2 was a special indicator of mesenchymal subtype. The survival analysis showed that highly-expressed ANXA2 was related to worse survival status as an independent factor of poor prognosis. Further gene ontology analysis showed that ANXA2 was mainly involved in immune response and inflammatory activities of glioma. Subsequent correlation analysis showed that ANXA2 was positively correlated with HCK, LCK, MHC II, STAT1 and interferon but negatively with IgG. Meanwhile, ANXA2 was positively related to the infiltration of tumor-related macrophages, regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Our study revealed that ANXA2 is a biomarker closely related to the malignant phenotype and poor prognosis of glioma, and plays an important role in immune response, inflammatory activity and immunosuppression."}

A total of 1096 patients (593 who had not received radiotherapy, and 503 who had) with primary stage IB-III uterine serous carcinoma who underwent surgery and received chemotherapy were included in the present study. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method and Log-Rank tests showed that radiotherapy did not increase 5-year overall survival rates compared with the no-radiotherapy groups (52.3 cf. 50.8%, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.641). Cox regression analysis subsequently corroborated that radiotherapy did not affect the 5-year overall survival rate (P\u2009=\u20090.635). Patients who were aged\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years had a higher mortality rate [hazard ratio (HR), 1.712; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.385\u20132.117; P\u2009<\u20090.05].

This approach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates. These findings show the remarkable potential of computer vision in characterizing the molecular basis of tumor histopathology."}

Crowe", "Lulu Wang", "Yong Lu", "W. Jeffrey Petty", "Amyn A. Habib", "Dawen Zhao"], "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment is profoundly immunosuppressive. Thus, mitigating tumor immunosuppression is crucial for inducing sustained antitumor immunity. Whereas previous studies involved intratumoral injection, we report here an inhalable nanoparticle-immunotherapy system targeting pulmonary antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance anticancer immunity against lung metastases. Inhalation of phosphatidylserine coated liposome loaded with STING agonist cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (NP-cGAMP) in mouse models of lung metastases enables rapid distribution of NP-cGAMP to both lungs and subsequent uptake by APCs without causing immunopathology. NP-cGAMP designed for enhanced cytosolic release of cGAMP stimulates STING signaling and type I interferons production in APCs, resulting in the pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment in multifocal lung metastases. Furthermore, fractionated radiation delivered to one tumor-bearing lung synergizes with inhaled NP-cGAMP, eliciting systemic anticancer immunity, controlling metastases in both lungs, and conferring long-term survival in mice with lung metastases and with repeated tumor challenge."}

Proximal and distal colon cancers exemplify such characteristics, with BRAFV600E predominantly occurring in proximal colon cancers along with increased DNA methylation phenotype. Using mouse colon organoids, here we show that proximal and distal colon stem cells have distinct transcriptional programs that regulate stemness and differentiation. We identify that the homeobox transcription factor, CDX2, which is silenced by DNA methylation in proximal colon cancers, is a key mediator of the differential transcriptional programs. Cdx2-mediated proximal colon-specific transcriptional program concurrently is tumor suppressive, and Cdx2 loss sufficiently creates permissive state for BRAFV600E-driven transformation. Human proximal colon cancers with CDX2 downregulation showed similar transcriptional program as in mouse proximal organoids with Cdx2 loss. Developmental transcription factors, such as CDX2, are thus critical in maintaining tissue-location specific transcriptional programs that create tissue-type origin specific dependencies for tumor development."}

ESR1 activating mutations also expanded in number and allele fraction during treatment and were associated with resistance. These data indicate that genomic alterations that mediate resistance to alpelisib or antiestrogen may promote disease progression and highlight PTEN loss as a recurrent mechanism of resistance to PI3K\u03b1 inhibition."}

Mitchell", "Michael M. Gottesman"], "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive and lethal forms of cancer. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for pancreatic cancer, but resistance to the drugs used remains a major challenge. A genome-wide CRISPR interference and knockout screen in the PANC-1 cell line with the drug nab-paclitaxel has identified a group of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) genes that enhance survival in nab-paclitaxel. Knockdown of these SAC genes (BUB1B, BUB3, and TTK) attenuates paclitaxel-induced cell death. Cells treated with the small molecule inhibitors BAY 1217389 or MPI 0479605, targeting the threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK), also enhance survival in paclitaxel. Overexpression of these SAC genes does not affect sensitivity to paclitaxel. These discoveries have helped to elucidate the mechanisms behind paclitaxel cytotoxicity. The outcomes of this investigation may pave the way for a deeper comprehension of the diverse responses of pancreatic cancer to therapies including paclitaxel. Additionally, they could facilitate the formulation of novel treatment approaches for pancreatic cancer."}

However, little is known about the prognostic impact of gBRCA1/2 mutations in aBC patients treated with chemotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the frequencies and prognosis of germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations in HER2- aBC patients receiving the first chemotherapy in the advanced setting. Patients receiving their first chemotherapy for HER2- aBC were retrospectively selected from the prospective PRAEGNANT registry (NCT02338167). Genotyping of 26 cancer predisposition genes was performed with germline DNA of 471 patients and somatic tumor DNA of 94 patients. Mutation frequencies, progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS) according to germline mutation status were assessed. gBRCA1/2 mutations were present in 23 patients (4.9%), and 33 patients (7.0%) had mutations in other cancer risk genes. Patients with a gBRCA1/2 mutation had a better OS compared to non-mutation carriers (HR: 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17\u20130.86). PFS comparison was not statistically significant. Mutations in other risk genes did not affect prognosis. Two somatic BRCA2 mutations were found in 94 patients without gBRCA1/2 mutations. Most frequently somatic mutated genes were TP53 (44.7%), CDH1 (10.6%) and PTEN (6.4%). In conclusion, aBC patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations had a more favorable prognosis under chemotherapy compared to non-mutation carriers. The mutation frequency of ~5% with gBRCA1/2 mutations together with improved outcome indicates that germline genotyping of all metastatic patients for whom a PARP inhibitor therapy is indicated should be considered."}

Here, we present ReSisTrace that uses shared transcriptomic features of sister cells to predict the states priming treatment resistance. Applying ReSisTrace in ovarian cancer cells perturbed with olaparib, carboplatin or natural killer (NK) cells reveals pre-resistant phenotypes defined by proteostatic and mRNA surveillance features, reflecting traits enriched in the upcoming subclonal selection. Furthermore, we show that DNA repair deficiency renders cells susceptible to both DNA damaging agents and NK killing in a context-dependent manner. Finally, we leverage the obtained pre-resistance profiles to predict and validate small molecules driving cells to sensitive states prior to treatment. In summary, ReSisTrace resolves pre-existing transcriptional features of treatment vulnerability, facilitating both molecular patient stratification and discovery of synergistic pre-sensitizing therapies."}

However, increased activity of metabolic enzymes is not usually considered an initiating event in the malignant process. Here, we investigate the possible role of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2) in lymphoma initiation. SHMT2 localizes to the most frequent region of copy number gains at chromosome 12q14.1 in lymphoma. Elevated expression of SHMT2 cooperates with BCL2 in lymphoma development; loss or inhibition of SHMT2 impairs lymphoma cell survival. SHMT2 catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and produces an activated one-carbon unit that can be used to support S-adenosyl methionine synthesis. SHMT2 induces changes in DNA and histone methylation patterns leading to promoter silencing of previously uncharacterized mutational genes, such as SASH1 and PTPRM. Together, our findings reveal that amplification of SHMT2 in cooperation with BCL2 is sufficient in the initiation of lymphomagenesis through epigenetic tumor suppressor silencing."}

CAR hinge and transmembrane regions link antigen recognition domains to intracellular signal transduction domains. Here, we apply biophysical methods to characterize the structure and dynamic properties of the CD28 CAR hinge (CD28H) used in an FDA-approved CD19 CAR for the treatment of B-lineage leukemia/lymphoma. By using nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), which detects even transiently occupied structural motifs, we observed otherwise elusive local structural elements amidst overall disorder in CD28H, including a conformational switch from a native \u03b2-strand to a 310-helix and polyproline II helix-like structure. These local structural motifs contribute to an overall loosely formed extended geometry that could be captured by NOESY data. All FDA-approved CARs use prolines in the hinge region, which we find in CD28, and previously in CD8\u03b1, isomerize to promote structural plasticity and dynamics. These local structural elements may function in recognition and signaling events and constrain the spacing between the transmembrane and antigen recognition domains. Our study thus demonstrates a method for detecting local and transient structure within intrinsically disordered systems and moreover, our CD28H findings may inform future CAR design."}

Here we identify the\u00a0TGF-\u03b22 isoform at the interface between these observations. We document that acidic pH promotes autocrine TGF-\u03b22 signaling, which in turn favors the formation of lipid droplets (LD) that represent energy stores readily available to support anoikis resistance and cancer cell invasiveness. We find that, in cancer cells of various origins, acidosis-induced TGF-\u03b22 activation promotes both partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fatty acid metabolism, the latter supporting Smad2 acetylation. We show that upon TGF-\u03b22 stimulation, PKC-zeta-mediated translocation of CD36 facilitates the uptake of fatty acids that are either stored as triglycerides in LD through DGAT1 or oxidized to generate ATP to fulfill immediate cellular needs. We also address how, by preventing fatty acid mobilization from LD, distant metastatic spreading may be inhibited."}

Patient\u2019s prognosis is hardly predictable, as commonly employed MM risk models do not precisely partition high- from low-risk patients, preventing the reliable recognition of early relapsing/refractory patients. By a dimensionality reduction approach, here we dissect the genomic landscape of a large cohort of newly diagnosed MM patients, modelling all the possible interactions between any MM chromosomal alterations. We highlight the presence of a distinguished cluster of patients in the low-dimensionality space, with unfavorable clinical behavior, whose biology was driven by the co-occurrence of chromosomes 1q CN gain and 13 CN loss. Presence or absence of these alterations define MM patients overexpressing either CCND2 or CCND1, fostering the implementation of biology-based patients\u2019 classification models to describe the different MM clinical behaviors."}

However, most patients are resistant to immunotherapies and the mechanisms underlying this resistant is still poorly understood. Here, we report that overexpression of BMP7, a member of the TGFB superfamily, represents a mechanism for resistance to anti-PD1 therapy in preclinical models and in patients with disease progression while on immunotherapies. BMP7 secreted by tumor cells acts on macrophages and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, inhibiting MAPK14 expression and impairing pro-inflammatory responses. Knockdown of BMP7 or its neutralization via follistatin in combination with anti-PD1 re-sensitizes resistant tumors to immunotherapies. Thus, we identify the BMP7 signaling pathway as a potential immunotherapeutic target in cancer."}

SE translocation (SET) is overexpressed in lung tumors and correlates with unfavorable prognosis. Here we uncover SET-associated transcription factor, zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 11 (ZBTB11), as a prometastatic regulator in lung tumors. SET interacts and collaborates with ZBTB11 to promote lung cancer cell migration and invasion, primarily through SET-ZBTB11 complex-mediated transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). Additionally, by transcriptional repression of proline-rich Gla protein 2 (PRRG2), ZBTB11 links Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activation to drive lung tumor metastasis independently of SET-ZBTB11 complex. Loss of ZBTB11 suppresses distal metastasis in a lung tumor mouse model. Overexpression of ZBTB11 is recapitulated in human metastatic lung tumors and correlates with diminished survival. Our study demonstrates ZBTB11 as a key metastatic regulator and reveals diverse mechanisms by which ZBTB11 modulates lung tumor metastasis."}

Here, we describe the generation of clonal populations from a patient-derived ovarian clear cell carcinoma model which forms malignant ascites and solid peritoneal tumors upon intraperitoneal transplantation in mice. The clonal populations are engineered with secreted Gaussia luciferase to monitor tumor growth dynamics and tagged with a unique DNA barcode to track their fate in multiclonal mixtures during tumor progression. Only one clone, CL31, grows robustly, generating exclusively malignant ascites. However, multiclonal mixtures form large solid peritoneal metastases, populated almost entirely by CL31, suggesting that transient cooperative interclonal interactions are sufficient to promote metastasis of CL31. CL31 uniquely harbors ERBB2 amplification, and its acquired metastatic activity in clonal mixtures is dependent on transient exposure to amphiregulin, which is exclusively secreted by non-tumorigenic clones. Amphiregulin enhances CL31 mesothelial clearance, a prerequisite for metastasis. These findings demonstrate that transient, ostensibly innocuous tumor subpopulations can promote metastases via \u201chit-and-run\u201d commensal interactions."}

Nonetheless, the limited clinical success of V\u03b42 T cell-based treatments may be attributed to donor variability, short-lived persistence, and tumor immune evasion. To address these constraints, we engineer V\u03b42 T cells with enhanced attributes. By employing CD16 as a donor selection biomarker, we harness V\u03b42 T cells characterized by heightened cytotoxicity and potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) functionality. RNA sequencing analysis supports the augmented effector potential of V\u03b42 T cells derived from CD16 high (CD16Hi) donors. Substantial enhancements are further achieved through CAR and IL-15 engineering methodologies. Preclinical investigations in two ovarian cancer models substantiate the effectiveness and safety of engineered CD16Hi V\u03b42 T cells. These cells target tumors through multiple mechanisms, exhibit sustained in vivo persistence, and do not elicit graft-versus-host disease. These findings underscore the promise of engineered CD16Hi V\u03b42 T cells as a viable therapeutic option for cancer treatment."}

In addition, recent evidence suggests that high-affinity binding to BCMA can result in on-target, off-tumor activity in the basal ganglia and can lead to fatal Parkinsonian-like disease. Here we develop CAR T cells against multiple myeloma using a binder to targeting transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) in mono and dual-specific formats with anti-BCMA. These CARs have robust, antigen-specific activity in vitro and in vivo. We also show that TACI RNA expression is limited in the basal ganglia, which may circumvent some of the toxicities recently reported with BCMA CARs. Thus, single-targeting TACI CARs may have a safer toxicity profile, whereas dual-specific BCMA-TACI CAR T cells have potential to avoid the antigen escape that can occur with single-antigen targeting."}

We sought molecular targeted therapy that induce HRD in HR-proficient cells to induce synthetic lethality with PARPi and extend the utility of PARPi. Here, we demonstrate that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is an important regulator for OC. Importantly, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 induces HRD and sensitizes HR-proficient OC cells to PARPi in vitro and in multiple in vivo models. Mechanistically, LSD1 inhibition directly impairs transcription of BRCA1/2 and RAD51, three genes essential for HR, dependently of its canonical demethylase function. Collectively, our work indicates combination with LSD1 inhibitor could greatly expand the utility of PARPi to patients with HR-proficient tumor, warranting assessment in human clinical trials."}

However, the impact of global adipose metabolism on tumor growth and the drug development by targeting adipose metabolism remain largely unexplored. Here we show that a therapeutic paradigm of drugs is effective for treating various cancer types by browning adipose tissues. Mirabegron, a clinically available drug for overactive bladders, displays potent anticancer effects in various animal cancer models, including untreatable cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, via the browning of adipose tissues. Genetic deletion of the uncoupling protein 1, a key thermogenic protein in adipose tissues, ablates the anticancer effect. Similarly, the removal of brown adipose tissue, which is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis, attenuates the anticancer activity of mirabegron. These findings demonstrate that mirabegron represents a paradigm of anticancer drugs with a distinct mechanism for the effective treatment of multiple cancers."}

This study is to evaluate the prognosis of IGH and IGK/IGL rearrangement-based MRD detected by next-generation sequencing in B-ALL at the end of induction (EOI) and end of consolidation (EOC). IGK/IGL rearrangements identify 5.5% of patients without trackable IGH clones. Concordance rates for IGH and IGK/IGL are 79.9% (cutoff 0.01%) at EOI and 81.0% (cutoff 0.0001%) at EOC, respectively. Patients with NGS-MRD\u2009<\u20090.01% at EOI or <0.0001% at EOC present excellent outcome, with 3-year event-free survival rates higher than 95%. IGH-MRD is prognostic at EOI/EOC, while IGK-MRD at EOI/EOC and IGL-MRD at EOI are not. At EOI, NGS identifies 26.2% of higher risk patients whose MRD\u2009<\u20090.01% by flow cytometry. However, analyzing IGK/IGL along with IGH fails to identify additional higher risk patients both at EOI and at EOC.

Knocking down SND1 in human prostate epithelial cells, especially those overexpressing ERG, negatively impacts cell proliferation. Transcriptional analysis shows substantial overlap in genes regulated by ERG and SND1. Mechanistically, we show that ERG promotes nuclear localization of SND1/MTDH. Forced nuclear localization of SND1 prominently increases its growth promoting function irrespective of ERG expression. In mice, prostate-specific Snd1 deletion reduces cancer growth and tumor burden in a prostate cancer model (PB-Cre/Ptenflox/flox/ERG mice), Moreover, we find a significant overlap between prostate transcriptional signatures of ERG and SND1. These findings highlight SND1\u2019s crucial role in prostate tumorigenesis, suggesting SND1 as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer."}

We developed MSIntuit, a clinically approved artificial intelligence (AI) based pre-screening tool for MSI detection from haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stained slides. After training on samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a blind validation is performed on an independent dataset of 600 consecutive CRC patients. Inter-scanner reliability is studied by digitising each slide using two different scanners. MSIntuit yields a sensitivity of 0.96\u20130.98, a specificity of 0.47-0.46, and an excellent inter-scanner agreement (Cohen\u2019s \u03ba: 0.82).

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a high intratumoral heterogeneity with neuronal and oligodendroglial lineage signatures.

Using chemical genetic screens, we identify that co-inhibition of topoisomerase I (TOP1) and NEDD8 is synergistically cytotoxic in human CRC cells. Combination of the TOP1 inhibitor irinotecan or its bioactive metabolite SN38 with the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor pevonedistat exhibits synergy in CRC patient-derived organoids and xenografts. Mechanistically, we show that pevonedistat blocks the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent repair of TOP1 DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP1-DPCs) induced by TOP1 inhibitors and that the CUL4-RBX1 complex (CRL4) is a prominent ubiquitin ligase acting on TOP1-DPCs for proteasomal degradation upon auto-NEDD8 modification during replication. We identify DCAF13, a DDB1 and Cullin Associated Factor, as the receptor of TOP1-DPCs for CRL4. Our study not only uncovers a replication-coupled ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for the repair of TOP1-DPCs but also provides molecular and translational rationale for combining TOP1 inhibitors and pevonedistat for CRC and other types of cancers."}

During leukapheresis, calcium gluconate solution was continuously supplemented intravenously with hourly measurement of iCa. 76 patients including 49 lymphapheresis for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and 27 stem cell collections were enrolled. Median processing blood volume was 10\u00a0L (range, 6\u201315\u00a0L). Fluctuating hypercalcemia, in which the iCa concentration rose above its upper limit 1\u00a0h after leukapheresis, was observed in 58 subjects (76.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher ratios of processing blood volume to body weight, more rapid calcium supplementation, and lower iCa concentration at the end of leukapheresis significantly increased elevation of serum iCa concentration by 1\u00a0h after leukapheresis. Based on multivariate analyses, we developed a formula and a diagram that accurately estimates serum iCa concentration 1\u00a0h post-leukapheresis. This suggests optimal targets for iCa concentration and calcium supplementation rates. In cases with high ratios of processing blood volume to body weight, slowing the rate of blood processing, rather than increasing calcium supplementation should safely alleviate hypocalcemia during leukapheresis without inducing hypercalcemia thereafter."}

Nevertheless, several limitations are known. Therefore, developing an alternative or complementary non-invasive tool capable of increasing the accuracy of the screening process is highly desirable. The objective of this study was to identify circulating microRNA (miRs) ratios associated with BC in women attending mammography screening. A nested case\u2013control study was conducted within the ANDROMEDA cohort (women of age 46\u201367 attending BC screening). Pre-diagnostic plasma samples, information on life-styles and common BC risk factors were collected. Small-RNA sequencing was carried out on plasma samples from 65 cases and 66 controls. miR\u00a0ratios associated with BC were selected by two-sample Wilcoxon test and lasso logistic regression. Subsequent assessment by RT-qPCR of the miRs contained in the selected miR\u00a0ratios was carried out as a platform validation. To identify the most promising biomarkers,\u00a0penalised logistic regression was further applied to candidate miR\u00a0ratios alone, or in combination with non-molecular factors. Small-RNA sequencing yielded 20 candidate miR\u00a0ratios associated with BC, which were further assessed by RT-qPCR. In the resulting model, penalised logistic regression selected seven miR\u00a0ratios (miR-199a-3p_let-7a-5p, miR-26b-5p_miR-142-5p, let-7b-5p_miR-19b-3p, miR-101-3p_miR-19b-3p, miR-93-5p_miR-19b-3p, let-7a-5p_miR-22-3p and miR-21-5p_miR-23a-3p), together with body mass index (BMI), menopausal status (MS), the interaction term BMI\u2009*\u2009MS, life-style score and breast density. The ROC AUC of the model was 0.79 with a sensitivity and specificity of 71.9% and 76.6%, respectively. We identified biomarkers potentially useful for BC screening measured through a widespread and low-cost technique. This is the first study reporting circulating miRs for BC detection in a screening setting. Validation in a wider sample is warranted."}

To assess the impact of new therapeutic agents, we performed retrospective analysis for consecutive 158 metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who performed systemic therapy in our institution between May 2008 and August 2023. We defined a period from May 2008 to December 2017, when pembrolizumab was first introduced to the clinical setting in the new therapeutic agents for metastatic urothelial carcinoma in Japan, as \u201cpre new drug era\u201d and a period from January 2018 to August 2023 as \u201cpost new drug era\u201d. We compared overall survival between pre- and post- new drug era using Kaplan\u2013Meier method with log rank test. Median overall survival of pre- and post- new drug era were 14.5\u00a0months (95% confidence intervals: 11.6\u201316.7) and 23.1\u00a0months (95% confidence intervals: 14.5-NA), respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Five-year survival rate of pre- and post- new drug era was 7.0% (95% confidence intervals: 2.3\u201315.3) and 36.3% (95% confidence intervals: 21.4\u201351.5), respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of factors associated with overall survival showed that enfortumab vedotin\u00a0administration, administration of second-line or more systemic therapy, best overall response of SD, PR and CR in first-line systemic therapy, higher serum albumin and lower CRP were factors for overall survival prolongation. Introduction of new therapeutic agents for metastatic urothelial carcinoma contributed to the improvement of overall survival in comparison with the era without these agents."}

However, there is still an unmet need for ex vivo models able to readily assess the effectiveness of immunotherapeutic treatments in a high-throughput and patient-specific manner. To address this issue, we have developed a microarrayed system of patient-derived tumoroids with recreated immune microenvironments that are optimized for the high-content evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte functionality. Here we show that this system offers unprecedented opportunities to evaluate tumor immunogenicity, characterize the response to immunomodulators, and explore novel approaches for personalized immuno-oncology."}
{"title": "Personalizing neoadjuvant immune-checkpoint inhibition in patients with melanoma", "published": "05 May 2023", "authors": ["Minke W. Lucas", "Judith M. Versluis", "Elisa A. Rozeman", "Christian U. Blank"], "abstract": "Neoadjuvant immune-checkpoint inhibition is a promising emerging treatment approach for patients with surgically resectable macroscopic stage III melanoma. The neoadjuvant setting provides an ideal platform for personalized therapy owing to the very homogeneous nature of the patient population and the opportunity for pathological response assessments within several weeks of starting treatment, thereby facilitating the efficient identification of novel biomarkers. A pathological response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors has been shown to be a strong surrogate marker of both recurrence-free survival and overall survival, enabling timely analyses of the efficacy of novel therapies in patients with early\u00a0stage disease. Patients with a major pathological response (defined as the presence of \u226410% viable tumour cells) have a very low risk of recurrence, which offers an opportunity to adjust the extent of surgery and any subsequent adjuvant therapy and follow-up monitoring. Conversely, patients who have only a partial pathological response or who do not respond to neoadjuvant therapy still might benefit from therapy escalation and/or class switch during adjuvant therapy. In this Review, we outline the concept of a fully personalized neoadjuvant treatment approach exemplified by the current developments in neoadjuvant therapy for patients with resectable melanoma, which could provide a template for the development of similar approaches for patients with other immune-responsive cancers in the near future."}

Over the past few decades, numerous techniques leveraging NIR-II light have been developed with the aim of precisely eliminating tumours while maximally preserving organ function. During cancer surgery, NIR-II optical imaging enables the visualization of clinically occult lesions and surrounding vital structures with increased sensitivity and resolution, thereby enhancing surgical quality and improving patient prognosis. Furthermore, the use of NIR-II light promises to improve cancer phototherapy by enabling the selective delivery of increased therapeutic energy to tissues at greater depths. Initial clinical studies of NIR-II-based imaging and phototherapy have indicated impressive potential to decrease cancer recurrence, reduce complications and prolong survival. Despite the encouraging results achieved, clinical translation of innovative NIR-II techniques remains challenging and inefficient; multidisciplinary cooperation is necessary to bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical practice, and thus accelerate the translation of technical advances into clinical benefits. In this Review, we summarize the available clinical data on NIR-II-based imaging and phototherapy, demonstrating the feasibility and utility of integrating these technologies into the treatment of cancer. We also introduce emerging NIR-II-based approaches with substantial potential to further enhance patient outcomes, while also highlighting the challenges associated with imminent clinical studies of these modalities."}

Kulkarni", "Sevin\u00e7 Jakab", "Till Rostalski", "Carleen Spegg", "Simon Anders", "Hellmut G. Augustin"], "abstract": "In metastasis, cancer cells travel around the circulation to colonize distant sites. Due to the rarity of these events, the immediate fates of metastasizing tumor cells (mTCs) are poorly understood while the role of the endothelium as a dissemination interface remains elusive. Using a newly developed combinatorial mTC enrichment approach, we provide a transcriptional blueprint of the early colonization process. Following their arrest at the metastatic site, mTCs were found to either proliferate intravascularly or extravasate, thereby establishing metastatic latency. Endothelial-derived angiocrine Wnt factors drive this bifurcation, instructing mTCs to follow the extravasation\u2013latency route. Surprisingly, mTC responsiveness towards niche-derived Wnt was established at the epigenetic level, which predetermined tumor cell behavior. Whereas hypomethylation enabled high Wnt activity leading to metastatic latency, methylated mTCs exhibited low activity and proliferated intravascularly. Collectively the data identify the predetermined methylation status of disseminated tumor cells as a key regulator of mTC behavior in the metastatic niche."}

The emergence of antibodies targeting tumor cell-surface antigens led to advancements in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies, particularly blood cancers. Yet their impact is constrained against tumors of hematopoietic origin manifesting in the skin. In this study, we employ a clonality-supervised deep learning methodology to dissect key pathological features implicated in mycosis fungoides, the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Our investigations unveil the prominence of the IL-32\u03b2\u2013major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I axis as a critical determinant in tumor T-cell immune evasion within the skin microenvironment. In patients\u2019 skin, we find MHC-I to detrimentally impact the functionality of natural killer (NK) cells, diminishing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and promoting resistance of tumor skin T-cells to cell-surface targeting therapies. Through murine experiments in female mice, we demonstrate that disruption of the MHC-I interaction with NK cell inhibitory Ly49 receptors restores NK cell anti-tumor activity and targeted T-cell lymphoma elimination in vivo. These findings underscore the significance of attenuating the MHC-I-dependent immunosuppressive networks within skin tumors. Overall, our study introduces a strategy to reinvigorate NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses to overcome treatment resistance to existing cell-surface targeted therapies for skin lymphoma."}

We retrospectively selected 31 consecutive patients, who underwent both MRAs and CTA, prior to the intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy (IACRT) for head and neck cancer. Four patients underwent IACRT bilaterally, so we analyzed 35 ECAs. Pseudo-continuous, three-dimensional ASL using a turbo field echo sequence was acquired. For the TOF-MRA and CTA, clinically used parameters were applied. Two observers evaluated each ECA branch with reference to the angiogram at the IACRT, using five-point scale, in consensus. Friedman test for multiple comparisons was applied. ASL-MRA and CTA better visualized the superior thyroid, lingual, facial, submental, transverse facial, and internal maxillary arteries (IMAs) better than TOF-MRA (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, CTA was superior to ASL-MRA in visualizing only submental artery among these arteries (p\u2009=\u20090.0005). Alternatively, the ASL-MRA was superior for visualizing the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and IMA, compared to the CTA (p\u2009=\u20090.0001 and 0.0007, respectively). ASL-MRA was superior to the TOF-MRA and similar to the CTA in visualizing most of ECA branches. Furthermore, ASL-MRA can better visualize the periphery of MMA and IMA than CTA."}

However, durable cures following anti-BCMA CAR-T cell treatment of myeloma are rare. One potential reason is that a small subset of minimal residual myeloma cells seeds relapse. Residual myeloma cells following BCMA-CAR-T-mediated treatment show less-differentiated features and express stem-like genes, including CD24. CD24-positive myeloma cells represent a large fraction of residual myeloma cells after BCMA-CAR-T therapy. In this work, we develop CD24-CAR-T cells and test their ability to eliminate myeloma cells. We find that CD24-CAR-T cells block the CD24-Siglec-10 pathway, thereby enhancing macrophage phagocytic clearance of myeloma cells. Additionally, CD24-CAR-T cells polarize macrophages to a M1-like phenotype. A dual-targeted BCMA-CD24-CAR-T exhibits improved efficacy compared to monospecific BCMA-CAR-T-cell therapy. This work presents an immunotherapeutic approach that targets myeloma cells and promotes tumor cell clearance by macrophages."}

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a transplant center in Thailand to investigate the incidence of post-transplantation cancer and mortality rates. Factors associated with post-transplantation cancer and patient outcomes were analyzed using competing-risks regression. The study included 1156 KTR with a post-transplant follow-up duration of 5.1 (2.7\u20139.4) years. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of post-transplant cancer was highest for urothelial cancer (6.9 per 1000 person-years), which also resulted in the highest standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 42.5 when compared to the general population. Kidney cancer had the second-highest SIR of 24.4. Increasing age was the factor associated with an increased risk of post-transplant cancer (SHR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.05). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR mismatch was associated with a decreased risk of post-transplant cancer (SHR 0.72; 95% CI 0.52\u20130.98).

We use 2D versus 3D cultivation to induce a shift in the cellular phenotype of breast cancer cells. We discover that proline catabolism via proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) supports growth of breast cancer cells in 3D culture. Subsequently, we link proline catabolism to in vivo metastasis formation. In particular, we find that PRODH expression and proline catabolism is increased in metastases compared to primary breast cancers of patients and mice. Moreover, inhibiting Prodh is sufficient to impair formation of lung metastases in the orthotopic 4T1 and EMT6.5 mouse models, without adverse effects on healthy tissue and organ function. In conclusion, we discover that Prodh is a potential drug target for inhibiting metastasis formation."}

Regardless of classification, most newly diagnosed patients receive the same treatment, radiation and temozolomide (RT/TMZ). We developed a functional precision oncology test that prospectively identifies individual patient\u2019s response to this treatment regimen. Tumor tissues isolated from patients with newly diagnosed HGG enrolled in 3D PREDICT REGISTRY were evaluated for response to chemotherapeutic agents using the 3D Predict\u2122 Glioma test. Patients receiving RT/TMZ were followed for 2 years. Clinical outcomes including imaging, assessments, and biomarker measurements were compared to patient matched test-predicted therapy response. Median survival between test-predicted temozolomide responders and test-predicted temozolomide non-responders revealed a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival when using the test to predict response across multiple subgroups including HGG (5.8 months), glioblastoma (4.7\u00a0months), and MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma (4.7 months). Overall survival was also positively separated across the subgroups at 7.6, 5.1, and 6.3\u00a0months respectively. The strong correlation of 3D Predict Glioma test results with clinical outcomes demonstrates that this functional test is prognostic in patients treated with RT/TMZ and supports aligning clinical treatment to test-predicted response across varying HGG subgroups."}

However, the exact role of immune cells in OS remains unknown. We aimed to distinguish the molecular subtypes and establish a prognostic model in OS patients based on immunocyte infiltration. The gene expression profile and corresponding clinical feature of OS patients were obtained from TARGET and GSE21257 datasets. MCP-counter and univariate Cox regression analyses were applied to identify immune cell infiltration-related molecular subgroups. Functional enrichment analysis and immunocyte infiltration analysis were performed between two subgroups. Furthermore, Cox regression and LASSO analyses were performed to establish the prognostic model for the prediction of prognosis and metastasis in OS patients. The subgroup with low infiltration of monocytic lineage (ML) was related to bad prognosis in OS patients. 435 DEGs were screened between the two subgroups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed these DEGs were involved in immune- and inflammation-related pathways. Three important genes (including TERT, CCDC26, and IL2RA) were identified to establish the prognostic model. The risk model had good prognostic performance for the prediction of metastasis and overall survival in OS patients. A novel stratification system was established based on ML-related signature. The risk model could predict the metastasis and prognosis in OS patients. Our findings offered a novel sight for the prognosis and development of OS."}

To address this dire situation, we have developed iodine nanoparticles (INPs) that target brain tumors after intravenous (IV) injection. The iodine then absorbs X-rays during radiotherapy (RT), creating free radicals and local tumor damage, effectively boosting the local RT dose at the tumor. Efficacy was tested using the very aggressive human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, MDA-MB-231 cells) growing in the brains of athymic nude mice. With a well-tolerated non-toxic IV dose of the INPs (7\u00a0g iodine/kg body weight), tumors showed a heavily iodinated rim surrounding the tumor having an average uptake of 2.9% iodine by weight, with uptake peaks at 4.5%. This is calculated to provide a dose enhancement factor of approximately 5.5 (peaks at 8.0), the highest ever reported for any radiation-enhancing agents. With RT alone (15\u00a0Gy, single dose), all animals died by 72\u00a0days; INP pretreatment resulted in longer-term remissions with 40% of mice surviving 150\u00a0days and 30% surviving\u2009>\u2009280\u00a0days."}

We collected a total of 166 cervical exfoliated cells and divided them into five groups based on histopathological results. Each sample was divided into two portions, one for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection and the other for bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP) detection. We found that FISH detection of CAPZB mRNA mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and BSP detection of CAPZB deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) percentage of methylation rate (PMR) performed as biomarkers for distinguishing HSIL from LSIL, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and cut-off value of 0.893, 81.25%, 80.39% and 0.616, 0.794, 64.06%, 81.37% and 0.454, respectively. Furthermore, FISH detection of CAPZB mRNA exhibited a greater AUC (0.893) for the detection of HSIL than the CAPZB DNA methylation method (0.794), indicating the CAPZB mRNA levels can be used as a biomarker for assessing cervical lesions."}

However, the precise mechanisms of TAMs-induced LN metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, we identify a long noncoding RNA, termed Lymph Node Metastasis Associated Transcript 1 (LNMAT1), which is upregulated in LN-positive bladder cancer and associated with LN metastasis and prognosis. Through gain and loss of function approaches, we find that LNMAT1 promotes bladder cancer-associated lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis. Mechanistically, LNMAT1 epigenetically activates CCL2 expression by recruiting hnRNPL to CCL2 promoter, which leads to increased H3K4 tri-methylation that ensures hnRNPL binding and enhances transcription. Furthermore, LNMAT1-induced upregulation of CCL2 recruits macrophages into the tumor, which promotes lymphatic metastasis via VEGF-C excretion. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for LNMAT1-modulated tumor microenvironment in lymphatic metastasis and suggest that LNMAT1 may represent a potential therapeutic target for clinical intervention in LN-metastatic bladder cancer."}

This study aims to determine whether combining radiotherapy with sorafenib administration increases its efficacy. The study cohort included 4763 patients with diagnosed advanced HCC who received sorafenib between January 2012 and December 2015, as reported in medical records in the Taiwan Cancer Registry database. The effect of sorafenib with or without radiotherapy on survival was calculated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. Patients receiving sorafenib plus radiotherapy had greater 1-year survival than did those receiving sorafenib alone (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Uni- and multivariate analyses also showed that radiotherapy increased survival after adjusting for confounders (adjusted HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.51\u20130.63). Further stratified analysis according to the timing of radiotherapy relative to sorafenib treatment revealed that patients who underwent radiotherapy after sorafenib had greater 1-year survival than did those undergoing radiotherapy within sorafenib use or sorafenib alone (adjusted HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.27\u20130.54). Combined treatment with sorafenib and radiotherapy results in greater HCC patient survival and should be considered an option for treating this challenging disease."}

While in the vasculature, these cells are referred to as circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and can be found as either single cells or clusters of cells (often including platelets), with the latter having the highest metastatic potential. However, the biology of CTC clusters is poorly understood, and there are no therapies that specifically target them. We previously developed an in vitro model system for CTC clusters and proposed a new extravasation model that involves cluster dissociation, adherence, and single-cell invasion in response to TGF-\u03b21 released by platelets. Here, we investigated TGF-\u03b21-induced gene expression changes in this model, focusing on genes for which targeted drugs are available. In addition to the upregulation of the TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway, we found that (i) genes in the EGF/EGFR pathway, including those coding for EGFR and several EGFR ligands, were also induced, and (ii) Erlotinib and Osimertinib, two therapeutic\u00a0EGFR/tyrosine kinase inhibitors, decreased the TGF-\u03b21-induced adherence and invasion of the CTC cluster-like line despite the line expressing wild-type EGFR. Overall, we suggest that EGFR inhibitors have the potential to decrease the dispersal of CTC clusters that respond to TGF-\u03b21 and overexpress EGFR (irrespective of its status) and thus could improve patient survival."}

Neutral ceramidase is a key regulator of ceramide, the central intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism. The contribution of neutral ceramidase to the reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment is not well understood. Here, we find that deletion of neutral ceramidase in multiple breast cancer models in female mice accelerates tumor growth. Our result show that Ly6C+CD39+ tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells are enriched in the tumor microenvironment and display an exhausted phenotype. Deletion of myeloid neutral ceramidase in vivo and in vitro induces exhaustion in tumor-infiltrating Ly6C+CD39+CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, myeloid neutral ceramidase is required for the generation of lipid droplets and for the induction of lipolysis, which generate fatty acids for fatty-acid oxidation and orchestrate macrophage metabolism. Metabolite ceramide leads to reprogramming of macrophages toward immune suppressive TREM2+ tumor associated macrophages, which promote CD8 T cells exhaustion."}

However, it has been difficult to discern patterns of dissemination owing to the limited number of patients and available metastases. Here, we use phylogenetic techniques on data generated using whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of primary and multiple-matched metastatic tumours from ten autopsied patients to infer the evolutionary history of breast cancer progression. We observed two modes of disease progression. In some patients, all distant metastases cluster on a branch separate from their primary lesion. Clonal frequency analyses of somatic mutations show that the metastases have a monoclonal origin and descend from a common \u2018metastatic precursor\u2019. Alternatively, multiple metastatic lesions are seeded from different clones present within the primary tumour. We further show that a metastasis can be horizontally cross-seeded. These findings provide insights into breast cancer dissemination."}

A higher proportion of early-differentiated Memory Stem (TSCM) and Central Memory BM-T cells express multiple IR in relapsing patients than in CR patients. Exhausted BM-T cells at relapse display a restricted TCR repertoire, impaired effector functions and leukemia-reactive specificities. In 57 patients, early detection of severely exhausted (PD-1+Eomes+T-bet\u2212) BM-TSCM predicts relapse. Accordingly, leukemia-specific T cells in patients prone to relapse display exhaustion markers, absent in patients maintaining long-term CR.

The objective of this study was to estimate the reduction in deaths for each cancer type under the scenario where peak mortality rates had remained stable in Canada. Data for this study were obtained the Global Cancer Observatory and Statistics Canada. We estimated age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR, per 100,000) from 1950 to 2022, standardized to the 2011 Canadian standard population. We identified peak mortality rates and applied the age-specific mortality rates from the peak year to the age-specific Canadian population estimates for subsequent years (up to 2022) to estimate the number of expected deaths. Avoided cancer deaths were the difference between the observed and expected number of cancer deaths. There have been major reductions in deaths among cancers related to tobacco consumption and other modifiable lifestyle habits (417,561 stomach; 218,244 colorectal; 186,553 lung; 66,281 cervix; 32,732 head and neck; 27,713 bladder; 22,464 leukemia; 20,428 pancreas; 8863 kidney; 3876 esophagus; 290 liver). There have been 201,979 deaths avoided for female-specific cancers (breast, cervix, ovary, uterus). Overall, there has been a 34% reduction in mortality for lung cancer among males and a 9% reduction among females. There has been a significant reduction in cancer mortality in Canada since site-specific cancer mortality rates peaked decades ago for many cancers. This shows the exceptional progress made in cancer control in Canada due to substantial improvements in prevention, screening, and treatment.

We retrospectively reviewed data from 114 patients with HER2-negative ABC who underwent PB therapy from November 2011 to December 2019. We calculated the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) as representative systemic immunity markers. The time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) of the patients with high ALC, low NLR, and high LMR were significantly longer compared with those of the patients with low ALC, high NLR, and low LMR. A multivariable analysis revealed that high ALC, low NLR, and low PLR were independent predictors for TTF and high ALC, low NLR, and high LMR were independent predictors for OS. Systemic immunity markers were significantly associated with longer TTF and OS in patients who underwent PB therapy and may represent predictive markers for PB therapy in patients with HER2-negative ABC."}

Our results from a Phase 1 clinical trial indicate a rapid decrease of 2HG levels by 70% (CI 13%, P\u2009=\u20090.019) after 1 week of treatment. Importantly, inhibition of mutant IDH1 may lead to the reprogramming of tumor metabolism, suggested by simultaneous changes in glutathione, glutamine, glutamate, and lactate.

C-angle was defined as the angle occupied by the tumor from the center of the kidney in the coronal CT images. Other nephrometry scores were calculated and compared with C-angle. Associations between C-angle and perioperative outcomes were examined. Significant differences were found in C-angle between tumors greater and less than 4\u00a0cm, exophytic and endophytic tumors, and hilar and non-hilar tumors. C-angle was correlated with other nephrometry scores, including RENAL, PADUA, and C-index.

We show that MYC or MYCN amplification in patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) generates sensitivity to PARPi via Myc-mediated transcriptional repression of CDK18, while most tumors without amplification are not sensitive. In response to PARPi, CDK18 facilitates ATR activation by interacting with ATR and regulating ATR-Rad9/ATR-ETAA1 interactions; thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR) and PARPi resistance. CDK18 knockdown or ATR inhibition in GSCs suppressed HR and conferred PARPi sensitivity, with ATR inhibitors synergizing with PARPis or sensitizing GSCs. ATR inhibitor VE822 combined with PARPi extended survival of mice bearing GSC-derived orthotopic tumors, irrespective of PARPi-sensitivity. These studies identify a role of CDK18 in ATR-regulated HR. We propose that combined blockade of ATR and PARP is an effective strategy for GBM, even for low-Myc GSCs that do not respond to PARPi alone, and potentially other PARPi-refractory tumors."}

Clemons"], "abstract": "TP53, a critical tumour suppressor gene, is mutated in over half of all cancers resulting in mutant-p53 protein accumulation and poor patient survival. Therapeutic strategies to target mutant-p53 cancers are urgently needed. We show that accumulated mutant-p53 protein suppresses the expression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xC\u2212, through binding to the master antioxidant transcription factor NRF2. This diminishes glutathione synthesis, rendering mutant-p53 tumours susceptible to oxidative damage. System xC\u2212 inhibitors specifically exploit this vulnerability to preferentially kill cancer cells with stabilized mutant-p53 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is a novel and robust predictive biomarker for APR-246, a first-in-class mutant-p53 reactivator that also binds and depletes glutathione in tumours, triggering lipid peroxidative cell death. Importantly, system xC\u2212 antagonism strongly synergizes with APR-246 to induce apoptosis in mutant-p53 tumours. We propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers that accumulate mutant-p53 protein by inhibiting the SLC7A11\u2013glutathione axis."}

Gillespie", "Aruna Balgi", "Nagarajan Kannan", "William J. Muller", "Michel Roberge", "Shoukat Dedhar"], "abstract": "Cancer cells frequently have amplified centrosomes that must be clustered together to form a bipolar mitotic spindle, and targeting centrosome clustering is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. A high-content chemical screen for inhibitors of centrosome clustering identified Stattic, a Stat3 inhibitor. Stat3 depletion and inhibition in cancer cell lines and in tumours in vivo caused significant inhibition of centrosome clustering and viability. Here we describe a transcription-independent mechanism for Stat3-mediated centrosome clustering that involves Stathmin, a Stat3 interactor involved in microtubule depolymerization, and the mitotic kinase PLK1. Furthermore, PLK4-driven centrosome amplified breast tumour cells are highly sensitive to Stat3 inhibitors. We have identified an unexpected role of Stat3 in the regulation of centrosome clustering, and this role of Stat3 may be critical in identifying tumours that are sensitive to Stat3 inhibitors."}

Although previous studies have utilized deep learning to assess breast density, the limited public availability of data and quantitative tools hinders the development of better assessment tools. Our objective was to (1) create and share a large dataset of pixel-wise annotations according to well-defined criteria, and (2) develop, evaluate, and share an automated segmentation method for breast, FGT, and blood vessels using convolutional neural networks. We used the Duke Breast Cancer MRI dataset to randomly select 100 MRI studies and manually annotated the breast, FGT, and blood vessels for each study. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The model achieved DSC values of 0.92 for breast, 0.86 for FGT, and 0.65 for blood vessels on the test set. The correlation between our model\u2019s predicted breast density and the manually generated masks was 0.95. The correlation between the predicted breast density and qualitative radiologist assessment was 0.75. Our automated models can accurately segment breast, FGT, and blood vessels using pre-contrast breast MRI data. The data and the models were made publicly available."}

Age and SMI/SMD has not been widely studied. The present study analyses the association between age and SMI/SMD after adjustment for other clinicopathological factors. Patients undergoing resectional surgery for TNM Stage I-III disease within the West of Scotland between 2011 and 2014 were identified. A single CT slice was obtained from each patients staging CT scan. SMI and SMD were stratified normal/abnormal. The SIR was stratified using Systemic Inflammatory Grade (SIG). When stratified by age (<\u200950/50s/60s/70s/80+), 39%/38%/48%/62%/74% and 27%/48%/64%/82%/92% of patients had a low SMI and SMD respectively (both p\u2009<\u20090.001). Older age (OR 1.47, p\u2009<\u20090.001), female sex (OR 1.32, p\u2009=\u20090.032), lower socioeconomic deprivation (OR 1.15, p\u2009=\u20090.004), higher ASA (OR 1.30, p\u2009=\u20090.019), emergency presentation (OR 1.82, p\u2009=\u20090.003), lower BMI (OR 0.67, p\u2009<\u20090.002) and higher SIG (OR 1.23, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independently associated with low SMI. Older age (OR 2.28, p\u2009<\u20090.001), female sex (OR 1.38, p\u2009=\u20090.038), higher ASA (OR 1.92, p\u2009<\u20090.001), emergency presentation (OR 1.71, p\u2009=\u20090.023), and higher SIG (OR 1.37, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were independently associated with lower SMD. Tumour factors were not independently associated with either SMI/SMD. Age was a major factor associated with low SMI/SMD in patients with colon cancer. Therefore, in these patients it is likely that this represents largely constitutional body composition as opposed to being a disease mediated effect. Adjustment for age is required when considering the cancer mediated effect on SMI/SMD in patients with colon cancer."}

As a recently defined biomarker, Pan-Immune-Inflammation-Value (PIV) integrates different peripheral blood cell subpopulations. This retrospective study of collected data aimed to assess whether PIV may predict the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in Turkish women with breast cancer. The study consisted of 743 patients with breast cancer who were scheduled to undergo NAC before attempting cytoreductive surgery. A pre-treatment complete blood count was obtained in the two weeks preceding NAC, and blood-based biomarkers were calculated from absolute counts of relevant cell populations. The pCR was defined as the absence of tumor cells in both the mastectomy specimen and lymph nodes. Secondary outcome measures included disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). One hundred seven patients (14.4%) had pCR. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, optimal cut-off values for the neutrophile-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), PIV, and Ki-67 index were determined as \u2265\u20092.34, \u2265\u20090.22, \u2265\u2009131.8, \u2265\u2009306.4, and \u2009\u2265\u200927, respectively. The clinical tumor (T) stage, NLR, MLR, PLR, PIV, estrogen receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status, and Ki-67 index were significantly associated with NAC response in univariate analyses. However, multivariate analysis revealed that the clinical T stage, PIV, ER status, HER-2 status, and Ki-67 index were independent predictors for pCR. Moreover, the low PIV group patients had significantly better DFS and OS than those in the high PIV group (p\u2009=\u20090.034, p\u2009=\u20090.028, respectively). Based on our results, pre-treatment PIV seems as a predictor for pCR and survival, outperforming NLR, MLR, PLR in predicting pCR in Turkish women with breast cancer who received NAC. However, further studies are needed to confirm our findings."}

It is generally assumed that early oncogenic changes are largely dependent on virus-encoded products, especially TAX and HBZ, while progression to acute leukaemia/lymphoma involves somatic mutations, yet that both are independent of proviral integration site that has been found to be very variable between tumours. Here, we show that HTLV-1/BLV proviruses are integrated near cancer drivers which they affect either by provirus-dependent transcription termination or as a result of viral antisense RNA-dependent cis-perturbation. The same pattern is observed at polyclonal non-malignant stages, indicating that provirus-dependent host gene perturbation contributes to the initial selection of the multiple clones characterizing the asymptomatic stage, requiring additional alterations in the clone that will evolve into full-blown leukaemia/lymphoma."}

DPN can be difficult to distinguish from melanoma but rarely displays aggressive biological behavior. Here, we identify a combination of mutations of the \u03b2-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as characteristic of DPN. Mutations of the \u03b2-catenin pathway change the phenotype of a common nevus with BRAF mutation into that of DPN, with increased pigmentation, cell volume and nuclear cyclin D1 levels. Our results suggest that constitutive \u03b2-catenin pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by overriding dependencies on the microenvironment that constrain proliferation of common nevi. In melanoma that arose from DPN we find additional oncogenic alterations. We identify DPN as an intermediate stage in the step-wise progression from nevus to melanoma. In summary, we delineate specific genetic alterations and their sequential order, information that can assist in the diagnostic classification and grading of these distinctive neoplasms."}

The role of 2-port access laparoscopy (TPA) has been underestimated. Compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CL), TPA is associated with smaller total incision size and less postoperative pain. Compared to single-incision laparoscopic surgery, no specific instruments and surgical techniques are needed. This study primarily evaluated the surgical and pathologic outcomes of TPA with conventional instruments, and additionally evaluated the surgeon\u2019s learning curve. Consecutive patients who underwent TPA and CL for endometrial cancer between 2015 and 2019 were included. Baseline characteristics were recorded. In total, 148 patients (TPA, 89; CL, 59) were identified. The baseline characteristics were similar, except for a greater proportion of patients in the CL group receiving para-aortic lymph node dissection (5.62% vs. 35.59%, P\u2009<\u20090.01). The mean operation time was significantly less in the TPA group (152.09 vs. 187.15\u00a0min; P\u2009<\u20090.01). Both the groups had comparable 5-year progression-free survival (TPA, 86.68%) and 5-year overall survival rates (TPA, 93.24%). Analysis of the learning curve showed that the operation time decreased after 3\u20134 procedures. TPA using conventional laparoscopic instruments for endometrial cancer is feasible and is easily accessible to patients and surgeons."}

We show that CTCF and cohesin, which are master regulators of chromatin architecture, display low expression in hyperdiploid ALL. In line with this, a general genome-wide dysregulation of gene expression in relation to topologically associating domain (TAD) borders were seen in the hyperdiploid group. Furthermore, Hi-C of a limited number of hyperdiploid childhood ALL cases revealed that 2/4 cases displayed a clear loss of TAD boundary strength and 3/4 showed reduced insulation at TAD borders, with putative leukemogenic effects."}

A cohort of 726 patients with NPC was examined to identify correlations between SUVmax and various clinical variables. RNA sequencing was performed to identify genes related to SUVmax, and these genes were used to develop an SUV signature. Additionally, transcriptome enrichment analysis was conducted to investigate the potential biological behaviors underlying the observed correlations. Higher SUVmax was associated with an increased tumor burden and worse prognosis. The SUV signature, which consisted of 10 genes, was positively correlated with SUVmax, and it predicted worse survival outcomes. This signature was highly expressed in malignant epithelial cells and associated with hypoxia and resistance to radiotherapy. Additionally, the signature was negatively correlated with immune function. SUVmax is a valuable prognostic indicator in NPC, with higher values predicting worse outcomes. The SUV signature offers further prognostic insights, linking glucose metabolism to tumor aggressiveness, treatment resistance, and immune function, and it could represent a potential biomarker for NPC."}

Thus, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms triggered by KRAS oncogene may yield alternative therapeutic strategies. Here we report the identification of a common transcriptional signature across mutant KRAS cancers of distinct tissue origin that includes the transcription factor FOSL1. High FOSL1 expression identifies mutant KRAS lung and pancreatic cancer patients with the worst survival outcome. Furthermore, FOSL1 genetic inhibition is detrimental to both KRAS-driven tumour types. Mechanistically, FOSL1 links the KRAS oncogene to components of the mitotic machinery, a pathway previously postulated to function orthogonally to oncogenic KRAS. FOSL1 targets include AURKA, whose inhibition impairs viability of mutant KRAS cells. Lastly, combination of AURKA and MEK inhibitors induces a deleterious effect on mutant KRAS cells. Our findings unveil KRAS downstream effectors that provide opportunities to treat KRAS-driven cancers."}

A total of 15,746 subjects who underwent breast ultrasound examinations were initially enrolled in the study. Further evaluation was performed on subjects with solid breast masses (\u2264\u20095\u00a0cm) intended for surgical resection and/or biopsy. The orientation angle, defined as the acute angle between the align of the maximal longitudinal diameter of the breast mass and the surface of the breast skin, was measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted, and various performance measures including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, odds ratio, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if the orientation angle was an independent predictor of breast malignancy. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was also conducted to assess the net benefit of adopting the orientation angle for predicting breast mass malignancy. The final analysis included 83 subjects with breast cancer and 135 subjects with benign masses. The intra-group correlation coefficient for the measurement of the orientation angle of breast masses was 0.986 (P\u2009=\u20090.001), indicating high reproducibility. The orientation angles of malignant and benign breast masses were 36.51\u2009\u00b1\u200914.90 (range: 10.7\u201388.6) degrees and 15.28\u2009\u00b1\u20098.40 (range: 0.0\u201358.7) degrees, respectively, and there was a significant difference between them (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The cutoff value for the orientation angle was determined to be 22.9\u00b0. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, odds ratio, and AUC for the prediction of breast malignancy using the orientation angle were 88.0%, 87.4%, 81.1%, 92.2%, 87.6%, 50.67%, and 0.925%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the orientation angle (>\u200922.9\u00b0), not circumscribed margin, and calcifications of the breast mass were independent factors predicting breast malignancy. The net benefit of adopting the orientation angle for predicting breast malignancy was 0.303. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that quantifying the orientation angle of breast masses is useful in predicting breast malignancy, as it demonstrates high sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and standardized net benefit. It optimizes the utility of the not parallel orientation in assessing breast mass malignancy."}

Recently, the survival of leukemia patients has increased thanks to the use of differentiating agents, though these may cause serious side effects. Hence, the search for safer differentiating compounds is necessary. Our aim was to assess the pro-differentiating effects of a flavonoid-rich extract of bergamot juice (BJe) in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, an in vitro AML model. For the first time, we showed that treatment with BJe induced differentiation of THP-1 cells, changes in cell morphology and increased expression of differentiation-associated surface antigens CD68, CD11b and CD14. Moreover, BJe enhanced protein levels of autophagy-associated markers, such as Beclin-1 and LC3, as well as induced the phosphorylation of the MAPKs JNK, ERK and p38, hence suggesting a potential mechanism underlying its antiproliferative effects. Indeed, parallel experiments highlighted that BJe was able to hamper THP-1 cell growth. In conclusion, our study suggests that BJe induces the differentiation of THP-1 cells and reduces their proliferation, highlighting its potential in differentiation therapy of AML."}

Here we present SIMMS (Subnetwork Integration for Multi-Modal Signatures): an algorithm that fragments pathways into functional modules and uses these to predict phenotypes. We apply SIMMS to multiple data types across five diseases, and in each it reproducibly identifies known and novel subtypes, and makes superior predictions to the best bespoke approaches. To demonstrate its ability on a new dataset, we profile 33 genes/nodes of the PI3K pathway in 1734 FFPE breast tumors and create a four-subnetwork prediction model. This model out-performs a clinically-validated molecular test in an independent cohort of 1742 patients. SIMMS is generic and enables systematic data integration for robust biomarker discovery."}

However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of ARM members in tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of neuroblastoma (NB) remain to be determined. Herein, we identify armadillo repeat\u00a0containing 12 (ARMC12) as an ARM member associated with NB progression. ARMC12 promotes the growth and aggressiveness of NB cell lines. Mechanistically, ARMC12 physically interacts with retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4) to facilitate the formation and activity of polycomb repressive complex 2, resulting in transcriptional repression of tumor suppressive genes. Blocking the interaction between ARMC12 and RBBP4 by cell-penetrating inhibitory peptide activates the downstream gene expression and suppresses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of NB cells. Both ARMC12 and RBBP4 are upregulated in NB tissues, and are associated with unfavorable outcome of patients. These findings suggest the crucial roles of ARMC12 in tumor progression and a potential therapeutic approach for NB."}

We observed an association between impaired IADL and lower geriatric G8 scores (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and lower adherence to ARPIs whether assessed by pill counting (p\u2009=\u20090.01) or self-reported by the patient himself (p\u2009=\u20090.03). The combination of an IADL\u2009<\u20096 and the absence of a caregiver resulted in a significantly high risk of non-adherence to the ARPIs at the multivariable analysis (HR 9.23, 95% confidence interval 2.28\u201337.43, p\u2009=\u20090.01). IADL alongside the geriatric G8 scales represent essential tools to identify frail and less auto-sufficient patients who are extremely vulnerable particularly if not supported by a caregiver and have the highest risk of nonadherence to ARPIs."}

Charles Manning", "Justin M. Balko"], "abstract": "Potentiating anti-tumor immunity by inducing tumor inflammation and T cell-mediated responses are a promising area of cancer therapy. Immunomodulatory agents that promote these effects function via a wide variety of mechanisms, including upregulation of antigen presentation pathways. Here, we show that major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) genes are methylated in human breast cancers, suppressing their expression. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with a next-generation hypomethylating agent, guadecitabine, upregulates MHC-I expression in response to interferon-\u03b3. In murine tumor models of breast cancer, guadecitabine upregulates MHC-I in tumor cells promoting recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the microenvironment. Finally, we show that MHC-I genes are upregulated in breast cancer patients treated with hypomethylating agents. Thus, the immunomodulatory effects of hypomethylating agents likely involve upregulation of class-I antigen presentation to potentiate CD8+ T cell responses. These strategies may be useful to potentiate anti-tumor immunity and responses to checkpoint inhibition in immune-refractory breast cancers."}

Data of low-risk PTC patients who underwent total/near total thyroidectomy and I-131 ablation 30\u00a0mCi between April 2015 and July 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical factors studied included age, sex, and pre-ablative serum thyroglobulin (Tg). Radiomic features were extracted via PyRadiomics, and radiomic feature selection was performed. The predictive performance for successful ablation of the clinical parameter, radiomic, and combined models (radiomics combined with clinical parameter) was calculated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). One hundred and thirty patients were included. Successful ablation was achieved in 77 patients (59.2%). The mean pre-ablative Tg in the unsuccessful group (15.50\u2009\u00b1\u200918.04\u00a0ng/ml) was statistically significantly higher than those in the successful ablation group (7.12\u2009\u00b1\u20097.15\u00a0ng/ml). The clinical parameter, radiomic, and combined models produced AUCs of 0.66, 0.77, and 0.87 in the training sets, and 0.65, 0.69, and 0.78 in the validation sets, respectively. The combined model produced a significantly higher AUC than that of the clinical parameter (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Radiomic analysis of the post-treatment TBS combined with pre-ablative serum Tg showed a significant improvement in the predictive performance of successful ablation in low-risk PTC patients compared to the use of clinical parameter alone."}

Patients with mCRC receiving regorafenib (n\u2009=\u2009100) were retrospectively assessed and divided into control and preexisting proteinuria (baseline grade of 1\u20132) groups. The primary endpoint was the development of grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 (grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 in case of baseline grade 2 patients) proteinuria. Propensity score-matching was performed to confirm the robustness of primary analyses. Defined proteinuria occurred in 30.7 and 57.9% of patients in the control and preexisting proteinuria groups, respectively, with significant differences in the all-patient population (P\u2009=\u20090.01). The preexisting proteinuria group exhibited significant defined proteinuria development within 7\u00a0days of regorafenib initiation, grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 symptoms, and treatment suspension owing to proteinuria. Similar results were obtained in the propensity score-matched population.

Here, we report upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) upon senescence, particularly in some stromal cell lines. Senescent cells display a PDK4-dependent increase in aerobic glycolysis and enhanced lactate production but maintain mitochondrial respiration and redox activity, thus adopting a special form of metabolic reprogramming. Medium from PDK4+ stromal cells promotes the malignancy of recipient cancer cells in vitro, whereas inhibition of PDK4 causes tumor regression in vivo. We find that lactate promotes reactive oxygen species production via NOX1 to drive the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, whereas PDK4 suppression reduces DNA damage severity and restrains the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. In preclinical trials, PDK4 inhibition alleviates physical dysfunction and prevents age-associated frailty. Together, our study confirms the hypercatabolic nature of senescent cells and reveals a metabolic link between cellular senescence, lactate production, and possibly, age-related pathologies, including but not limited to cancer."}

Our model is developed on a training cohort (n\u2009=\u20091362) and a validation cohort (n\u2009=\u2009340), and tested on an internal testing cohort (n\u2009=\u2009289) and two external cohorts (n\u2009=\u2009305 and 328, respectively).

Our model achieves high performance with area under receiver operator curve all above 0.90 in classifying major tumor types, in identifying tumor grades within type, and especially in distinguishing tumor genotypes with shared histological features. This integrated diagnosis model has the potential to be used in clinical scenarios for automated and unbiased classification of adult-type diffuse gliomas."}

However, we are currently unaware of any studies using selective and potent ClpP activators in lung squamous cell carcinoma. In this work, we report on such an activator, ZK53, which exhibits therapeutic effects on lung squamous cell carcinoma in vivo. The crystal structure of ZK53/ClpP complex reveals a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking effect that is essential for ligand binding selectively to the mitochondrial ClpP. ZK53 features on a simple scaffold, which is distinct from the activators with rigid scaffolds, such as acyldepsipeptides and imipridones. ZK53 treatment causes a decrease of the electron transport chain in a ClpP-dependent manner, which results in declined oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in lung tumor cells. Mechanistically, ZK53 inhibits the adenoviral early region 2 binding factor targets and activates the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated-mediated DNA damage response, eventually triggering cell cycle arrest. Lastly, ZK53 exhibits therapeutic effects on lung squamous cell carcinoma cells in xenograft and autochthonous mouse models."}

However, clinical application has been limited due to severe toxicity and the relatively low immune response rate, caused by wide distribution of cytokine receptors, systemic immune activation and short half-life of IL-15. Here we show that a biomimetic nanovaccine, developed to co-deliver IL-15 and an antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) selectively targets IL-15 to antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), thereby reducing off-target toxicity. The biomimetic nanovaccine is composed of cytomembrane vesicles, derived from genetically engineered dendritic cells (DC), onto which IL-15/IL-15 receptor \u03b1 (IL-15R\u03b1), tumor-associated antigenic (TAA) peptide/MHC-I, and relevant costimulatory molecules are simultaneously anchored. We demonstrate that, in contrast to conventional IL-15 therapy, the biomimetic nanovaccine with multivalent IL-15 self-transpresentation (biNV-IL-15) prolonged blood circulation of the cytokine with an 8.2-fold longer half-life than free IL-15 and improved the therapeutic window. This dual targeting strategy allows for spatiotemporal manipulation of therapeutic T cells, elicits broad spectrum antigen-specific T cell responses, and promotes cures in multiple syngeneic tumor models with minimal systemic side effects."}

Targeting ribosomes is an important strategy for cancer therapy. The ribosome inhibitor, homoharringtonine (HHT), is used for the clinical treatment of leukemia, yet it is ineffective for the treatment of solid tumors, the reasons for which remain unclear. Here we show that Snail1, a key factor in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, plays a pivotal role in cellular surveillance response upon ribotoxic stress. Mechanistically, ribotoxic stress activates the JNK-USP36 signaling to stabilize Snail1 in the nucleolus, which facilitates ribosome biogenesis and tumor cell survival. Furthermore, we show that HHT activates the JNK-USP36-Snail1 axis in solid tumor cells, but not in leukemia cells, resulting in solid tumor cell resistance to HHT. Importantly, a combination of HHT with the inhibition of the JNK-USP36-Snail1 axis synergistically inhibits solid tumor growth. Together, this study provides a rationale for targeting the JNK-USP36-Snail1 axis in ribosome inhibition-based solid tumor therapy."}

A randomized clinical trial (NCT02803593) was conducted from January 2017 to June 2020 among 199 AABC. The intervention group utilized TICAA and the American Cancer Society [ACS] website while the control group used only ACS website for 12 weeks. The outcomes were measured using the SCNS-34SF (needs; primary), the MSAS-SF (symptoms; secondary), and the FACT-B (quality of life; secondary). The data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach. The intervention group showed significant reductions in their needs from the baseline (T0) to post 4 weeks (T1) and to post 12 weeks (T2). Although the changes were not statistically significant, the intervention group had decreased symptoms from T0 to T2 while the control group had an increase in their symptoms. The intervention group had a significant increase in their quality of life from T0 to T2. A culturally tailored virtual program could therefore improve quality of life in AABC patients.

Here, we report the pro-tumorigenic properties of the crosstalk between intestinal tuft cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) that is evolutionarily optimized for epithelial remodeling in response to helminth infection. We demonstrate that tuft cell-derived interleukin 25 (IL25) drives ILC2 activation, inducing the release of IL13 and promoting epithelial tuft cell hyperplasia. While the resulting tuft cell - ILC2 feed-forward circuit promotes gastric metaplasia and tumor formation, genetic depletion of tuft cells or ILC2s, or therapeutic targeting of IL13 or IL25 alleviates these pathologies in mice. In gastric cancer patients, tuft cell and ILC2 gene signatures predict worsening survival in intestinal-type gastric cancer where ~40% of the corresponding cancers show enriched co-existence of tuft cells and ILC2s. Our findings suggest a role for ILC2 and tuft cells, along with their associated cytokine IL13 and IL25 as gatekeepers and enablers of metaplastic transformation and gastric tumorigenesis, thereby providing an opportunity to therapeutically inhibit early-stage gastric cancer through repurposing antibody-mediated therapies."}

While IDH1 mutation has been shown to promote gliomagenesis via DNA and histone methylation, little is known regarding its regulation in antiviral immunity. Here, we discover that IDH1 mutation inhibits virus-induced interferon (IFN) antiviral responses in glioma cells. Mechanistically, D2HG produced by mutant IDH1 enhances the binding of DNMT1 to IRF3/7 promoters such that IRF3/7 are downregulated, leading to impaired type I IFN response in glioma cells, which enhances the susceptibility of gliomas to viral infection. Furthermore, we identify DNMT1 as a potential biomarker predicting which IDH1mut gliomas are most likely to respond to oncolytic virus. Finally, both D2HG and ectopic mutant IDH1 can potentiate the replication and oncolytic efficacy of VSV\u039451 in female mouse models.

Relentless research efforts in molecular biology and drug development have led to the implementation of several HER2-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and antibody\u2013drug conjugates, constituting one of the best examples of bench-to-bedside translation in oncology. Each individual drug class has improved patient outcomes and, importantly, the combinatorial and sequential use of different HER2-targeted therapies has increased cure rates in the early stage disease setting and substantially prolonged survival for patients with advanced-stage disease. In this Review, we describe key steps in the development of the modern paradigm for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer, including selecting and sequencing new-generation HER2-targeted therapies, and summarize efficacy and safety outcomes from pivotal studies. We then outline the factors that are currently known to be related to resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, such as HER2 intratumoural heterogeneity, activation of alternative signalling pathways and immune escape mechanisms, as well as potential strategies that might be used in the future to overcome this resistance and further improve patient outcomes."}

Current diagnostic and surgical methods are reliable, but they require considerable resources and do not provide metabolomic insight. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) enables detailed, spatially resolved metabolomic analysis of tissue samples. Integrated with machine learning, MALDI-MSI could yield detailed information pertaining to the metabolic alterations characteristic for SCC. These insights have the potential to enhance SCC diagnosis and therapy, improving patient outcomes while tackling the growing disease burden. This study employs MALDI-MSI data, labelled according to histology, to train a supervised machine learning model (logistic regression) for the recognition and delineation of SCC. The model, based on data acquired from discrete tumor sections (n\u2009=\u200925) from a mouse model of SCC, achieved a predictive accuracy of 92.3% during cross-validation on the labelled data. A pathologist unacquainted with the dataset and tasked with evaluating the predictive power of the model in the unlabelled regions, agreed with the model prediction for over 99% of the tissue areas. These findings highlight the potential value of integrating MALDI-MSI with machine learning to characterize and delineate SCC, suggesting a promising direction for the advancement of mass spectrometry techniques in the clinical diagnosis of SCC and related keratinocyte carcinomas."}

Past work in breast cancer has shown that cancer detection method, screen-detected or symptom-detected, has prognostic significance. We investigate this phenomenon in the lung component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trial. Patients were randomized to intervention, receiving four annual chest x-rays (CXRs), or to control, receiving usual care. Patients were followed for a total of approximately 13 years. In PLCO, lung cancer detection method has independent prognostic value exceeding that of variables commonly used in lung cancer prognostic models, including sex, histology, and age. Results are robust to cohort selection and type of predictive model. These results imply that detection method should be considered when developing prognostic models in lung cancer studies, and cancer registries should routinely collect cancer detection method."}

Here we provide a comprehensive multiomics analysis including deep tandem mass tag-based quantitative global (phospho)proteomics, RNA sequencing, and nanopore DNA sequencing of 138 primary patient-derived plasma cell malignancies encompassing treatment-naive MM, plasma cell leukemia and the premalignancy monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, as well as healthy controls. We found that the (phospho)proteome of malignant plasma cells are highly deregulated as compared with healthy plasma cells and is both defined by chromosomal alterations as well as posttranscriptional regulation. A prognostic protein signature was identified that is associated with aggressive disease independent of established risk factors in MM. Integration with functional genetics and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed general and genetic subtype-specific deregulated proteins and pathways in plasma cell malignancies that include potential targets for (immuno)therapies. Our study demonstrates the potential of proteogenomics in cancer and provides an easily accessible resource for investigating protein regulation and new therapeutic approaches in MM."}

To date, four OVs and one non-oncolytic virus\u00a0have been approved for the treatment of cancer globally although talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) remains the only widely approved therapy. T-VEC is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent melanoma after initial surgery and was initially approved in 2015. An expanding body of data on the clinical experience of patients receiving T-VEC is now becoming available as are data from clinical trials of various other OVs in a range of other cancers. Despite increasing research interest, a better understanding of the underlying biology and pharmacology of OVs is needed to enable the full therapeutic potential of these agents in patients with cancer. In this Review, we summarize the available data and provide guidance on optimizing the use of OVs in clinical practice, with a focus on the clinical experience with T-VEC. We describe data on selected novel OVs that are currently in clinical development, either as monotherapies or as part of combination regimens. We also discuss some of the preclinical, clinical and regulatory hurdles that have thus far limited the development of OVs."}

Second generation 4-1BB/CD3zeta CAR containing high affinity humanized anti-V\u03b2 scFv is expressed efficiently on donor T cells via both lentivirus and adeno-associated virus transduction with limited detectable pre-existing immunoreactivity. Our optimized CAR-T cells demonstrate specific and persistent killing of V\u03b22+ Jurkat cells and V\u03b22+ patient derived malignant T cells, in vitro and in vivo, without affecting normal T cells. In parallel, we generate humanized anti-V\u03b22 antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by Fc-engineering for NK cell ADCC therapy."}

Sliwkowski", "Eunpi Cho"], "abstract": "Approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for HER2-positive breast cancer include trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan. To develop a differentiated HER2 ADC, we chose an antibody that does not compete with trastuzumab or pertuzumab for binding, conjugated to a reduced potency PBD (pyrrolobenzodiazepine) dimer payload. PBDs are potent cytotoxic agents that alkylate and cross-link DNA. In our study, the PBD dimer is modified to alkylate, but not cross-link DNA. This HER2 ADC, DHES0815A, demonstrates in vivo efficacy in models of HER2-positive and HER2-low cancers and is well-tolerated in cynomolgus monkey safety studies. Mechanisms of action include induction of DNA damage and apoptosis, activity in non-dividing cells, and bystander activity. A dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03451162) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of DHES0815A and secondary objectives of characterizing the pharmacokinetics, objective response rate, duration of response, and formation of anti-DHES0815A antibodies, is reported herein. Despite early signs of anti-tumor activity, patients at higher doses develop persistent, non-resolvable dermal, ocular, and pulmonary toxicities, which led to early termination of the phase 1 trial."}

Carlson", "Shuang Chang", "Mark A. Laurie", "Lei Xing", "Audrey K. Bowden", "Joseph C. Liao"], "abstract": "Diagnostic cystoscopy in combination with transurethral resection of the bladder tumour are the standard for the diagnosis, surgical treatment and surveillance of bladder cancer. The ability to inspect the bladder in its current form stems from a long chain of advances in imaging science and endoscopy. Despite these advances, bladder cancer recurrence and progression rates remain high after endoscopic resection. This stagnation is a result of the heterogeneity of cancer biology as well as limitations in surgical techniques and tools, as incomplete resection and provider-specific differences affect cancer persistence and early recurrence. An unmet clinical need remains for solutions that can improve tumour delineation and resection. Translational advances in enhanced cystoscopy technologies and artificial intelligence offer promising avenues to overcoming the progress plateau."}
{"title": "Development of a predictive nomogram for postembolization syndrome after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma", "published": "08 February 2024", "authors": ["Jinfeng Bai", "Ming Huang", "Jinmei Zhou", "Bohan Song", "Jianjie Hua", "Rong Ding"], "abstract": "Post-embolization syndrome (PES) is a frequent complication after receiving transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but only a few studies have focused on the factors influencing PES in those patients. In this study, the impact factors of PES were explored and a nomogram was constructed to predict the occurrence of PES in HCC patients with TACE. This was a retrospective cohort study of HCC patients who underwent TACE obtained from the third affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University between January 1, 2020, and September 1, 2022. T\u2011test and Chi\u2011square test were used to search for factors influencing PES occurrence, and then the nomogram was further established based on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Validation of the predictive nomogram was also evaluated by calibration curve, concordance index (C-index), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The enrolled patients (n\u2009=\u2009258) were randomly assigned to the primary cohort (n\u2009=\u2009180) and validation cohort (n\u2009=\u200978) in a 7:3 ratio. Among 180 patients in the primary cohort, 106 (58.89%) experienced PES. TACE types (P\u2009=\u20090.015), embolization degree (P\u2009=\u20090.008), and tumor number (P\u2009=\u20090.026) were identified as predictors by the logistic regression analysis and were used to develop the predictive nomogram. The internally validated and externally validated C-indexes were 0.713 and 0.703, respectively. The calibration curves presented good consistency between actual and predictive survival. Types of embolic agents, embolization degree, and tumor number were found to be the predictors of PES after TACE. The nomogram could reliably predict PES in HCC patients with TACE. This predictive model might be considered for clinical practice."}
{"title": "Combined CT radiomics of primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes improves prediction of loco-regional control in head and neck cancer", "published": "23 October 2019", "authors": ["Marta Bogowicz", "Stephanie Tanadini-Lang", "Matthias Guckenberger", "Oliver Riesterer"], "abstract": "Loco-regional control (LRC) is a major clinical endpoint after definitive radiochemotherapy (RCT) of head and neck cancer (HNC). Radiomics has been shown a promising biomarker in cancer research, however closer related to primary tumor control than composite endpoints. Radiomics studies often focus on the analysis of primary tumor (PT). We hypothesize that the combination of PT and lymph nodes (LN) radiomics better predicts LRC in HNC treated with RCT. Radiomics analysis was performed in CT images of 128 patients using Z-Rad implementation (training n\u2009=\u200977, validation n\u2009=\u200951). 285 features were extracted from PT and involved LN. Features were preselected with the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method and the multivariate Cox model was trained using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The mixed model was based on the combination of PT and LN radiomics, whereas the PT model included only the PT features. The mixed model showed significantly higher performance than the PT model (p\u2009<\u20090.01), c-index of 0.67 and 0.63, respectively; and better risk group stratification. The clinical nodal status was not a significant predictor in the combination with PT radiomics. This study shows that the LRC can be better predicted by expansion of radiomics analysis with LN features."}

We queried a retrospective monocentric database of patients with targeted biopsy. csPCa patients were defined as an International Society of Urological Pathology grade group\u2009\u2265\u20092. Group-level analyses and diagnostic accuracy of mean ADC values (ADCmean) within the tumor volume were assessed from Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests and receiving operating characteristic curves, respectively. Areas under the curve (AUC) and optimal cut-off values were calculated. 159 patients (105 rsEPI, 54 ssEPI; mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation: 65\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u00a0years) with 3T DWI, PZ lesions and targeted biopsy were selected. Both DWI sequences showed significantly lower ADCmean values for patients with csPCa. The rsEPI sequence better discriminates patients with csPCa (AUCrsEPI\u2009=\u20090.84, AUCssEPI\u2009=\u20090.68, p\u2009<\u20090.05) with an optimal cut-off value of 1232 \u03bcm2/s associated with a sensitivity\u2013specificity of 97%-63%. Our study showed that the rsEPI DWI sequence enhances the discrimination of patients with csPCa."}

Therefore, we examined temporal trends of characteristics of patients and treatment-na\u00efve HCCs within the Milan criteria treated by RFA over 20\u00a0years. We retrospectively analysed 1099 patients with HCC within the Milan criteria treated with percutaneous RFA from January 2000 to December 2019. The overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and factors affecting survival and local tumor progression were analysed using the Kaplan\u2012Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. A trend test was performed to analyse the changing trends in participants and treatment outcomes. The overall and RFS of patients improved during the later period. In addition, viral hepatitis-related HCC incidence decreased, whereas that of alcohol- or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related HCC increased from the earlier to the later period (P for trend\u2009<\u20090.001). HBV antiviral therapy was increased and improved OS and RFS in patients treated using RFA. The outcomes after RFA over a 20-year period improved due to changes over time in target tumors and patients. The results could be useful for selecting patients who will benefit from RFA."}
